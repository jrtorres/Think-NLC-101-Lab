I stayed here during SXSW and had a really pleasant stay. The house is a very relaxing environment and Paddy is both a friendly and professional host. ,Environment

"We had a great stay at Zen East for South By Southwest! Paddy was extremely accommodating and we found the place to be exotic and homely. It was easy to settle right in and experience Austin, and everything was a short taxi or bus ride away. She had everything we needed for our stay, and we loved the zen vibe of the backyard garden.

"Paddy's home is charming and she is a very gracious host. She was kind enough to walk me around the neighborhood and make me feel at home.\r\r\r\rAt first I thought the location was a bit far from downtown, but there's a bus route that is a mere 2-blocks from her house and it takes all of 10-minutes to get to The Capital. Biking in the area is great too; it's about a 15-minute bike ride to/from Downtown. Paddy was kind enough to drive me to a bike rental shop.\r\r\r\rThe neighborhood is a bit eclectic with a mixture of Austin locals, artists and activists. I was fortunate to be there the same weekend as East Austin Studio Tours (EAST), which gave me a chance to explore that section of Austin. Paddy & I went to an outdoor performance that was a few blocks from her home, which was fantastic.\r\r\r\rPS: Diego is a cutie.",Hospitality

I did need to ask some questions/ request something, and the communication was always fast and helpful. My request was accommodated, no problem. I'm not sure a hotel would have done so. Here are some of the things I loved: the Japanese bath (the entire bathroom was sparkly clean), the sheets, the above and beyond comfy mattress, and the supply of ear plugs (I was attending a music fest). The walk around to the apartment reminded me a bit of a spa I've been to in New Mexico, even with the faintest, most relaxing sound of crickets.",Environment

Shortly after the reservation was confirmed I received the very comprehensive stay details that I needed to be prepared for my arrival and check-in. As I learned after I arrived, her description of the apartment was just as accurate as the online description and photos that were provided. Arrival and check-in was smooth and effortless, and the apt. had all of the amenities that one might expect and then some. From the Nespresso teas and coffees, flavored waters, microwave and refrigerator to the more than adequate toiletries, Susan seemed to have thought of everything that the traveler might need. The unit was clean, the bed very comfortable, the air conditioning great even with 100-plus degree days. Located in a very pretty, quiet neighborhood, I won't hesitate to book here again. Thanks to Susan and her husband for providing a true ""home away from home"".",Communication

There are so many lovely touches: decorating, having everything we needed at hand.

"Indeed, the place is a funky, artsy space that was comfortable, clean and safe. The neighborhood is interesting and Sevylla's place is super close to Onnit Academy/Gym so it's a great place to stay if you're taking a certification course there. Easy access to the freeway and a quick jaunt to all the cool places in the downtown area without being in the hustle and bustle of the city. The neighbors have roosters, so it's a good idea to have ear plugs.",Environment

The neighborhood is very family-friendly so don't expect lots of party noises, although the roosters in the neighborhood might wake you up if you're a light sleeper, so bring some earplugs. Personally I really enjoyed the environment and all of the unique birds (greckles, starlings, roosters and chickens). If you want to take the bus, it goes right by the front door. This was my second visit to Sevylla's Studio and I will definitely be coming back for my next trip to Austin",Environment
"Our top 5 reasons you'll want to stay here and nowhere else: Location - 15 minutes via rental car to downtown, 1 hr 20 min to San Antonio (must make the side trip!) and less than 3 hours from Dallas for ease of flights. Meticulously cleaned and organized in the flat. Everything you need for cooking (small countertop burner), fridge, dishware and more. Folder and guidebook left in the unit for planning activities, and an additional e-mail from Drew with local favorites. Privacy. We would see Drew and Simone in passing, and it felt like saying hello to neighbors. Very comfortable and private entrance into the flat, noise was never an issue.4. Water pressure in the shower. If you travel often, you know how important a good shower is. While slightly tight for two adults, the shower is well built into the private bath off the flat. ",Location
"How do you spell disappointment.I stayed at this location two years ago & thats why I decided to stay again.First of all the minute you walked in there was a stench that I could not figure what it was until the next morning when the cat was at the front door waiting to come in...it was obvious by this cats refusal to go away that he/she was familiar with coming inside.So then it hit me what that smell (Website hidden by Airbnb) great if you are a cat lover and don't mind smelling cat urine.Second, if you leave blankets around, don't leave the ones with blood on them.And how about putting a mattress cover on the mattress. Will never stay here again..and would not recommend anyone to stay there either.",Cleanliness
"We recently stayed in Sarah's cottage, and while there are some very nice things about it, sadly our experience wasn't as overwhelmingly positive as everyone else's. Positives: the cottage is cute and nicely decorated, with a really nice bathroom (great shower!) and a comfortable bed. It's also quiet, well located and with easy access to the rest of Austin and beyond. Negatives: the WIFI is almost non existent. When we did manage to connect, the signal was so weak it took a long time to load just a single page. As international travellers who can't use data while roaming and rely on free WIFI, this was very frustrating, especially as the property is advertised as having internet. The cottage could also do with some dusting / cleaning. It wasn't too bad (the main things, i.e. bathroom / bed were clean) but things like the fridge, shelves, floor etc. needed some attention. And finally, we also found the host unresponsive and not particularly helpful. ",Amenities
"I never met Sara. The only communication was text messages wanting to know whether we could leave early on thanksgiving so it could be cleaned for next guests. Perhaps she was gone. The house was in a quiet backyard with trees, close to my daughter and the cherrywood coffeehouse where we went everyday. The bed was really really comfortable.The only problems we had were an electric plug near the bed that didn't work and the refrigerator froze all our food even tho it was turned down low.

"A true gem, close to the city centre of Austin. A safe, quiet and beautiful area. The house is clean and has everything you need including dish washer, washing machine and dryer. Comfortable beds. I highly recommend this place. ",Amenities
"Location:Very secluded even though the highway is so close. You pull into a private residential street and then pull into their even more private tree-lined driveway. Very nice peaceful stay. If you need to keep in touch with the hosts, their house is just further down the driveway. On site hiking paths was awesome. Probably would've braved going down the trails more had I had better shoes. The whole property in general looks like an artistic public garden, a hidden jewel. We ended up bringing our car, which makes it easier to travel around and get things that we needed. Amenities:Modern decor, cute breakfast nook, fruits, pastry, snacks, water bottles, coffee/creamer, cups/plates/bowls, extra blankets, books/magazines about Austin, plus all the things you would expect from a hotel except better. They even provided things you didn't expect (like a colander!) but it was a pleasant surprise and we made use of these items.",Amenities
I would not recommend renting any house from this host because the house he rents out they are unsanitary the bed the couch carpet walls they were all dirty I question the The Host he said we are germophobic if we wanted cleaner house we should pay more.

"I don't love leaving negative reviews, but this was disappointing at best. The neighborhood is so Austin kooky, and the studio itself, though pretty rustic, has a cool funky vibe. But the black mold we found under the toilet seat, the grime we wiped out of the shower, the two-inch roach we killed, and the extraordinarily uncomfortable bed made us feel like we'd been swindled. I wouldn't let a friend stay there for free in its present state.",Cleanliness

While the apartment appeared to have clean sheets and a plethora of clean towels, the apartment was not nearly as clean as a hotel would be. There was a layer of dust on most of the furniture. The worst offense though was that the showers were not cleaned and he left considerable amounts of bath products in them such as loofahs and a squeegee. All of this could be fixed by a good scrub from professional cleaners. While east Austin was definitely walkable from the apartment, it was farther than we had expected based on the write up (and not something you'd want to do in heels!). The write up of the apartment was misleading in other ways. The write up proclaims that there is a fully stocked beer fridge, but fails to mention it is not for visitor use. ",Cleanliness

"We really enjoyed staying here for our recent bachelor party of 8 guys in Austin. It is in a perfect location that is walkable to all of the happening places downtown. It is a clean, modern condo with very convenient access thanks to the key code doorlock. The only negatives were:- This is an 8 person place, not 10. There are 3 king beds and a pull out. I do not have any idea where you sleep 2 more people. - A couple little things like no bathroom vent fans (a big problem with 8 dudes eating BBQ and drinking beer) and the TV not working very well.Overall it was a great place to stay and I would definitely stay there again.",Location
Overall we enjoyed our stay. The host did mention in the check-in instruction that voices in the hallway carry easily through the windows so I'd encourage any guest to bring ear plugs and eye mask. (We stayed over the mardi gras weekend.) The unit is on 3rd floor in an apt/condo complex with secured gates. Location is very safe and convenient where there are great restaurants and bars within walking distance. Our self check-in was easy and had enough towels to use. We also enjoyed ESPN channels.,Noise

"I can't think of a negative thing to say about this place. The house itself is lovely, peaceful, and well stocked. The fold-out futon was super comfortable, and was way more secluded than I was expecting (you don't have a door but it still feels like a private room). The balcony was so peaceful and great for watching weird Austin birds. 5 min walk to a bunch of great restaurants and coffee shops. It took us about 30-40 mins to walk to the Blanton/Bullock museum area.Non-dog people should be fine here. The dogs will totally keep to themselves after one quick bark and sniff on first meeting you. They'll be friendly to you only if you make the first move after that, and otherwise they'll ignore you. For dog people, these dogs are the cutest and really A+ at receiving belly rubs.We needed to cancel our first night and extend our last night by a day (thanks, new England weather) and Michelle was so sweetly accommodating about both last-minute changes.",Environment

We played them all. My WiFi addicted 15 and 17 year olds played with Leggos and actually laughed out loud, with us. Thank you Jake, Kelly, Rabbit and Bear.",Hospitality
"We were unimpressed with the outside surroundings of the house and cottage. We had to park on the street and then carry your luggage from the street through the gate down the driveway to the back of the house. This wouldn't have been as much of an ordeal had there not been large tree branches limbs and twigs strewn across the driveway. After going to dinner and returning after dark there was no lighting and my husband tripped over this debris trying to navigate back to the cottage. Another issue, although I LOVE dogs, was the large dog that was somewhat intimidating due to barking and jumping onto the window each time we had to walk by the main house. The bed was very comfy too. The only negative inside was the lack of a curtain on a large window that left us having to dress and undress in the bathroom. It was within walking distance to a few wonderful restaurants, which was great. Overall the experience was not great. I do believe just a couple tweaks and it would improve the experience greatly. ",Location
"I'll start with the pros: This space was clean and cute. Plenty of space for a couple (we also had our toddler with us and if you bring a pop-up crib, it should be just fine.) The apartment has it's own entrance and parking space, which was very nice.Now the negatives: The most frustrating part of our experience was the alarm system. We received a very thorough run down of the house via an iphone app provided by the property management company who deals with this listing. But there was no mention of an alarm. When we arrived, we noticed that the alarm would annoyingly beep every time we opened the door. My tech-savvy husband tried to turn that feature off and ended up arming the thing further. When we opened the door again, a crazy loud alarm went off. There was ZERO information with the code to disarm it and when we called the property management, it took them ages to track it down. We ended up getting a visit from the fire department and everything. ",Location
"No real issues. Place is clean and nice and well-maintained. Easy to access. Great, super convenient location. Parking isn't really an issue, either; plenty available nearby.Only negative thing is that it can be a little loud if it's a holiday / busy weekend in one of the bedrooms, due to the fact that it faces the street. Chalk it up to being near everything. ",Noise
"Mollie was great and so easy to communicate with. She shared us on a long list of great restaurants in the area to visit, which was very helpful.

"Clear, detailed communication and very responsive host/property manager. Clean space and in very close proximity to everything. Do NOT recommend for business travel as it does not offer very private rooms and would not fit 10 people comfortably. We had 6 and even that seemed like too many when you are staying with your coworkers. Acoustic in the space were not great, you could hear what every person was doing, even with the door closed. A little overpriced for what you get. This house would be great for younger travellers looking to attend the music or film portion of SXSW but really do not suggest it for business travel and do not suggest trying to fit 10 people.

Great for young party crowd, perfect actually, but I wouldn't recommend for a family/work trip. ",Environment

Beds are all different, 4 tiny twins shoved upstairs as an example instead of the one nice queen it shows. Also, we only had one half of a couch (two seats) and a random chair that didn't match anything and was disgusting. No pillows or nice coffee table as listed in photos. MOLD.

"It sounded like something must have been broken. We sent Brock a courtesy note through the Airbnb app then around 11pm, letting him know he may want to check it out.The response was quite surprising, and felt aggressive. At 3:40am we received a message back asking if we'd ever heard a washing machine before. 10-20 minutes later, another message saying that if it bothered me so much I could use the on site pay machines (even though laundry is listed as an amenity at his location). And even went on to say, «è_«è_«è_Wanna know what my complaint is? Getting woken up at 11:30 on a Monday about a loud washing machine. Poor you.«è_„ùWe were very taken aback by his approach, and tried to de-escalate the situation. To this, he ended up responding again in the morning (in a seemingly more calm manner) that he would have a look after we checked out after our stay.

The paranoia I experienced was not worth the money I saved. ",Environment
"I did not feel uncomfortable or sketched out with bed/bathroom arrangement, as some others have, just a bit awkward. More privacy would have been nice, maybe in the form of a curtain around the bed, as another reviewer suggested, but I was out of the room most of the day and he was often out or asleep when I was there, and even when we were both in the flat at the same time, the set-up didn't bother me much. However, I unfortunately did not sleep very well for the 4 nights I was there. The mattress seems to be well-used and consequentially sags a bit in some areas. I have slept on a variety of couches, beds, and futons at various hotels/hostels/Airbnb locations and usually do not have problems, but my back began to bother me after the 1st night and still does even 36 hours after I have left.

"BEWARE!! This Airbnb made me realize that I am not a minimalist traveler if that means I won't have a clean place to shower. The shower is covered in mold inbetween the tiles and on the grout. The underside of Cody's bathmat has mold growing on it. The toilet was left with dried fecal matter for many days. The windows and vents are covered in dust. If you have allergies they will be triggered by this, as the AC is often on because of the hot Texan weather. Bathroom situation is a bit awkward, it would not have been too bad if at least the bathroom was clean. Kitchen area is also filthy with dried food all over the microwave and he uses his kitchen as a storage area as well where he leaves piles of papers on top of the stove top. Window curtain which is right next to the bed is broken so it provides little coverage from the outside, which was a bit uncomfortable because Cody's apartment is ground level. Walls are paper thin and refrigerator is broken and makes startling thumps and noises. ",Cleanliness

My recent stay with Martha and Paul was wonderful. I ended up book with Martha last minute and received a confirmation within 30 minutes. They were both extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the city and recommended all the great places I need to see. The room was clean and cozy and couldn't have picked a better place to stay when in Austin!!!ThanksChris,Hospitality
"Our view of this accommodation is quite different to others, maybe it's all about expectation. We have been traveling for about a month and this place was the most lacking in modern conveniences. No cable TV (CNN, HBO, Disney JR), no dish washer, no clothes washer/drier, water heater couldn't handle 2 consecutive showers and water pressure is rather low. It's almost 20 km to the Hamilton Pools (pictured with the listing). Interior design was tasteful but rooms are dark. ",Amenities
"The owner also advertises 5 beds... two of the ""beds"" are 4 inch thick padding you put on the concrete floor and lay on. I attempted to call Steven about the uncomfortable heat twice and no one picked up. It wasn't until I called his partner that I received a response. Their ""trick"" to cooling the bedrooms was to close the air vents downstairs. Doing so wasn't difficult, but inconvenient. There is no real dining table, only the two seater you see in the first photo. The outdoor shower is filthy and full of rust. I didn't even want my dog to be rinsed off in it in fear of getting tetanus. Lastly, and most disturbing, I get the feeling that Steven doesn't wash all of the bedding linens in-between reservations. I will say that we are currently in disagreement over an extra $50 he is trying to charge me for having dog fur on a futon that has a washable cover. This issue has nothing to do with my review and if you do book with this terrible host, you'll see how awful Steven is. ",Environment
"The check in at Jenny's was very easy. The air conditioning worked very well and the bed was super comfy. It was an easy walk to Downtown Austin. The construction was loud, but Jenny had told us about it. It was quiet at night.",Noise
Cute and love the old house. Jenny has it decorated cute and it feels very welcoming. Location is great and within walking distance of some cute restaurants on West 6th Street. I love how it's tucked away but still close to alot of great places. ,Environment
"Our stay started off on a pretty bad note, we arrived after 2 pm which was the check in time. There was a car parked in the spot we were supposed to have so we parked in the front of the house and told Angel but asked if there were any other places to park. We were then told we couldn't park there because that spot was for guests staying in the house(nobody stayed there while we were there so nobody was using the spot) but we weren't given any other options for parking. We went to drop our bags off in the camper but we were greeted by a woman blocking the gate so we couldn't get in who asked ""what's this about?"" Overall our stay was pretty comfortable. I would have liked to get into the camper at 2(or at least a warning that it wasn't ready) so we could have planned around it. Definitely wouldn't pay $100 again to stay there.",Environment
"It's probably my fault for choosing to stay in a trailer. It's very bare bones. There is also a cat there that was constantly trying to eat my food, enter the shed, enter the bathroom shed with me.. I wouldn't do it again. The place is clean and it has running water and a toilet in a shed. I also liked the mini kitchen. It's just not for me. Again, probably my fault. I got caught up, I think, in the novelty and ignored the reality",Environment
Absolutely ADORED this camper! Super cozy and stylish! We had everything we needed and more. Loved seeing the neighbor's cats since they were so friendly. One of my favorite things was the outdoor shower... Try to shower at night if you can to catch a glimpse of the stars :) Would definitely recommend and will be staying again next time I'm in Austin!,Environment
"The home accurately depicts the images and is aesthetically well designed in a great location in Travis Heights near South Congress, etc. Some quirks and things to note on value - one of the beds was very squeaky so we changed rooms and the beds felt like doubles. The HVAC unit is dated and super loud, which interrupted our sleep each night from constantly turning on at length... We had to raise our voices during conversation in the living room when A/C kicked on. Subjective complaint(s) - there's post-it notes all over the house that need to be pared down, in my opinion, and picked up in a concise one-pager in the welcome handbook if there's a need to nip the bud from on-going guest complaints and or issues inside the home (modern design = intuitive user experience). We felt like kids staying at a friend's house whose overprotective parents watch over us with all the notes and instructions posted everywhere, along with the lingering ""we may see you during your stay"" noted. 3/5",Noise
"Crystal was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. We stayed here for my wedding weekend and it was perfect for our group. We even got ready at the house and had plenty of space. The house is nicely decorated and clean. We really appreciated being able to use the 2 car garage as well. The only con is that there is a bar directly behind the house that plays loud music until about 2 am. Other than that, we loved our stay and would highly recommend it for others!",Communication
"The apt is the lower part of a duplex. I don't know if the upper part of the duplex is also an Airbnb rental but I was disturbed by the noise coming from above and in and out of the front door (some young guys who were very loud and slamming the door at 10pm, 2am). I guess you just need to go out a lot! There also seemed to be a lot of car alarms going off in the neighborhood. It is in a fantastic location to 6th street, a park and several shops/restaurants. There was some coffee, 1 Corona and bottle of wine and some chocolate provided which is thoughtful. Not sure if there was cable? There was a guide in folder but no remote? There is Netflix which is awesome. Keyless entry is good but I could not remember 10 digit code code and had to keep my phone on me at all times. Responsive host when I contacted her regarding a leak. Would stay again. Thank you!",Noise
The place was clean. Location is OK.Construction right outside the bedroom window and neighbors upstairs were quite loud so not the best of rests ever.The deck and porch were not what were really portrayed... the place is a little dated. The bedroom door doesn't close and there are no curtains on the from door so not the most private either.Impossible to find a plug to charge your phone unless you shift all the bedroom furniture to search behind beds and sofas. Bed wasn't the most comfortable.For the price I was charged I really wasn't pleased at all with what I found.,Noise
Mireille's apartment was about a 15 minute stroll to central downtown. It was a great place to be based in Austin. Mireille is very easy to communicate with and check in and check out was a breeze. For people that like to sleep in I would recommend ear plugs and you can hear the people walking upstairs.,Noise
"The communication was good overall. I appreciated the company allowing us to have a late check out. However we were moved at the last minute to unit #504 which wasn't in great condition (marks on the walls, a big dent in the bathroom door, etc) my sheets had stains on them (though they were clean) and worst of all, there was an insect problem. We killed four giant bugs in the first 36 hours. The company sent a cleaning crew out right away and also set some traps, but since I found one bug in my bed I slept on the couch instead. The location is great -- I didn't mind the noise with ear plugs. But the bugs were gross and the place was not in great condition. ",Cleanliness

"Alexandria was an extremely communicative and available host that went above and beyond, going so far as to receive and deliver an overnighted package to me. The apartment is cute and comfortable. The A/Cs worked really well despite the extreme heat outdoors. Also the bar downstairs wasn't too loud even on Friday and Saturday nights. I ended up staying here alone and was a bit uncomfortable with the secluded entry and was disappointed that there were only door handle locks, not a deadbolt or chain. It was relatively tidy and clean but could use a refresh overall. I ended up enjoying and appreciating my stay here_ã”it was a good home base while I attended at conference at the Hilton, which was a 15 minute walk. ",Communication
"My family had to vacate this house after the AC failed in on a 100 degree day in July. I was unimpressed by Top Trip's efforts at fixing the AC, which wasted a whole day of our vacation. My and family and I will not stay at any of Top Trip's properties in the future because of this frustrating experience.The house itself was neither wonderful nor bad, merely meh in a way that would have rendered our stay there an entirely forgettable aspect of our vacation. It is located very close to attractions in South Austin that are enjoyable for adults, children and dogs alike. It has a nice back porch that is a pleasant spot for enjoying an evening breeze. Judging from other property reviews, Top Trip seems capable of addressing minor issues like an empty propane tank in the grill outside.They are not, however, ready to address a real issue like a failed AC unit on a Saturday night.

"Not what I expected. The house is very small. It wasn't a terrible place to stay but here are a couple issues to be aware of. WiFi isn't good in the bedroom, there isn't a tv in the bedroom, the bedroom ISNT private the door opens easily and doesn't lock none of the doors lock, and they kept changing the temperature to a high temperature. Ok good things though include: peaceful place to be, clean, and good accommodations such as towlels, bedding, and blankets.",Amenities
"I hate writing negative reviews, and especially because Kevin was a nice host, but the only way to describe this place was ""sub-standard."" The most important thing to note is that it really isn't a two-bedroom apartment. There's a bed in the living room. I mean, you could see it as a two-bedroom with no living room. In any case you either have no common area, or you're using one of the bedrooms as a common area. The kitchen is small and very poorly equipped. Old cheap cookware and no spices (not even pepper when we arrived - only salt). It wasn't horrific - there were clean linens etc, but stuff like the old coffee, and parts of the apartment that clearly hadn't been swept or dusted for a long time. The bathroom was terrible - the tub was just disgusting and didn't drain. After a couple of minutes, you'd be ankle-deep in water. ",Cleanliness
"Mari was very responsive and worked back and forth with me as we hammered out the details. She even admitted upfront that the location can be noisey, being right in the heart of downtown Austin (it really wasn't that bad at all!). The place is fantastic, especially for couples or a few friends staying in Austin, wanting to be in the center of everything. I live in Austin, but rented Mari's place out for friends visiting in town, so I'll add my austinite credibility here and say this is a great place to stay if you want to immerse yourself in Austin.",Communication

"Single-travelers beware: Good price and would definitely suit a group booking all together but terrible for single travelers wanting to relax at end of day. The fact you can hear every sound your neighbors make at all hours made me feel really uneasy anytime I was there hanging out in my own room. Great side of town and if you had the whole house booked (all three bedrooms) with people you know, you'd have a blast! I thought it was weird too that on checkout, the host asked guests to only leave a review if you gave them 5 stars. Come on guys.",Noise
"My stay here was okay. The host responded quickly through Airbnb messaging, but wasn't very helpful in answering my questions. There was no hair dryer and the host did not provide one upon request. Also, there was a french fry on the floor of my room the first day I moved in. No one came to take out the trash for days. There were also a bunch of dirty dishes in the dish washer for days. House keeping came in on one day and only stayed about 30 minutes to clean. I guess you get what you pay for. The amenities are minimal, but overall my stay wasn't bad. ",Amenities

"4 words - do not stay here! I've been a loyal AirBnB user for the past 4 years, and have not had a negative experience. The bed sheets hadn't been changed and washed, and I found stains and a few pieces of stray hairs. When I explained that this was a problem to the host, this was their response...I didn't get much sleep last night and have been traveling all day, and was hoping to relax and hit the sack early, when I stumbled on the unsightly scene - stray hairs and stains on the sheets from your previous guest!Unfortunately, the host took too long to respond, 8 hours to be exact, and by then, I was fed up. I wanted to give the host an opporunity to make things right, but they didn't even address the core issue, which was that I wanted the room to be cleaned. Although I did receive a refund for the rest of my stay, I still had to pay for my 1 night stay, which in principle I shouldnt have paid for. ",Communication
"My group and I stayed at Annie's for the new years and it was a fantastic place. Although we had a group of five, the place was big enough to hold 7-8. It came equipped with towels, a washer and dryer, and a dish washer. It's also a block away from the grocery store so you can get whatever you need. Proximity to 6th street was important to us and this was about a mile and a half away. 5 star place",Amenities
"First things first....Ty's place is nice. It's as it looks in the photos, but it's worth noting that the third bedroom is off the kitchen separated by a curtain. So in theory the kitchen and 3rd bedroom are the same room. The backyard is amazing and the bathroom is really nice as well...now, on to Ty. If you click my profile, you'll see i have over 50 Airbnb reviews, i'm a host and travel often. Ty pulled a fast one on us and then went missing. I booked a 5 night rental, more than a month in advace. The next morning (not even 12hrs after booking), i realized I only needed 3 nights, not 5. Ty has instant book turned on his reservation, 3 night minimum. So i messaged Ty and said, ""hey, can you change it to 3 nights"". He didn't respond...i emailed, i texted, i (Website hidden by Airbnb) response. A week goes by he says ""I'll get back to you"", he doesn't. Finally, I call Airbnb, they reach him and he says ""If they want to change for 3 nights, they have to pay $600"". ",Communication
"Don't even. No WiFi. No TV signal. No response from host. I guess you could read -- Oh wait, light bulbs burned out. Smelly, stiff towels.

GROSSLY OVERPRICED for marginal accommodations. I couldn't get out of there fast enough.",Amenities

My full experience so prevent you from wasting your money And time. I arrived and there was no hot water. Everyone knows that you're guests should be put first when you're hosting,that's means taking extra steps & double checking everything before your guests arrives just to lessen the possibility of any unnecessary inconveniences that could have been prevented for your new guest, Because everyone knows, FIRST impressions mean everything. Your guest is paying for the fees listed to stay at YOUR B&B. Your guest chose YOUR B&B out of hundreds of others for specific reasons based on what your listing advertised.

Marjorie has a beautiful home that is perfectly located on the edge of town- just close enough to be walking distance from downtown but far enough away to be peaceful. There are also a lot of cute cafes and restaurants right next door. I wish we could have stayed longer. My family and I had a great time.,Location
"Overall, a spectacular experience. The only slight downside was that it was a hike to get into downtown Austin, but certainly not insurmountable with a rental car/uber.The pluses way outweighed the location! The big 2 positives were the airstream itself, and the ridiculous hospitality of the Shannons.The airstream itself was super nice - a blend of vintage style and modern amenities. There's a fridge, dish washer, fully stocked kitchen, TV w/ cable, a big nice bed, a porch with great lighting for evening drinks. Everything was nice and worked well.The hospitality was on the next level. The Shannons left us a bottle of tequila and cocktail ingredients, coffee, cereal, local milk in glass bottles, candy.... Most impressively, on morning one we woke up to a tray left on our front porch with delicious breakfast tacos and OJ. Couldn't have nicer things to say about the Shannons, who felt like old friends who were letting my girlfriend and I stay with them on their property. ",Environment

"I'll start off by saying the house was very clean and was in a great location and I slept very comfortably. HOWEVER, the accuracy of her listing is completely misleading. BUYER BEWARE this house is listed as an ""entire home"" but there is an older guy that lives upstairs! We were appalled to find someone else walking around in the middle of the night and in the kitchen in the morning considering I was walking around in my sleepwear. Our safety was truly questionable as we had no idea of another guest.Our host was very rude to say the least. She would only communicate with us at 4am and would constantly berate us with convictions and threatened to evict us at 4:30 in the morning because of my service dog. She was very hostile with all her responses and chose to argue with us about the wifi password. It wasn't until the last day of our stay that we received the correct wifi password. We also had trouble with the AC because the man that was staying there turned the air from 69 to 78 every morning around 6AM. ",Communication

Mireille's place was one of the few available, and at good value.Location was excellent and easy to find, though I wished it was just a bit further from a busy intersection that generated a fair amount of road noise.Beds were clean, comfortable, and the fans + indoor AC units kept things cool during the warm days.

"4 out of 5 stars. Pros - You cant find a better view. You cant find a better location. You're in the heart of it all. This is a beautiful apartment and Jay was a fantastic host. Cons - Saying this place accommodates 6 is a stretch. Their was no air matress, only a love sac in the living room. The wifi didnt work and the TV could only stream (since there was no internet, it was useless). The neighbors are not nearly as polite about music as this listing asks. This place is LOUD. Rainey street goes most of the night and the neighbors right next door partied every night. All that said, its still a great place to stay. Nobody stays this close to the action expecting to stay in the room and watch Downton Abbey. This is a place to act as a base to experience all the great that Austin has. And it works perfectly for that. Sleep, shower, shave and out. Repeat as necessary. ",Location

"DO NOT STAY WITH THIS HOST! TLDR: When we arrived to the Airbnb we found out Carly, the host, put us in a different apartment than the listing which was a much smaller, dirty apartment and tried to deny the switch. Carly is a dishonest host and does not deserve anyone's business. We booked with Airbnb for 8 people and expected to be staying in the same place that was listed. On our way there Carly sent us a different address claiming that the one on Airbnb was incorrect. When we showed up and looked in the new apartment is was obvious it was not the one pictured in the listing AND there was someone in there still cleaning from the previous guests. The entire place was filthy. ",Hospitality

"Joch was a terrible host & I would never deal with him again. First off I was having trouble finding the unit & he never responded to my texts,Airbnb messages, or phone calls. Once I reached the unit I tried reaching him in regards to the TV not working & their being no toilet paper, he never responded. At about 11pm my boyfriend got fed up with him not responding and called him from his number. A woman answered the phone & said she would look for the Apple TV remote. Joch called back several minutes later & said that the last guest must have taken the remote & he would bring the remote along with toilet paper & that he would be their in less than 5 minutes. He never came, in fact he turned off his phone. Upon further inspection of the unit I noticed that throughout the whole bath tub their were these horrible orange stains. The toilet was filthy & their was no toilet paper! The kitchen was beautiful although cooking utensils were very minimal. ",Hospitality
"Our host did not provide instruction on which room was ours. Upon awkward investigation on our own, we found the previous guest's belongings in our room. Suitcase, items in the closet, items on the nightstand. Our host did not answer our calls or texts in a timely manner to assure us that our accommodations would be made right. A few hours later we heard from Maryam with sincere apologies about the situation. She told us that our bed sheets were being replaced with clean ones. We received a 20% discount for the inconveniences but I think our host is trying to juggle too much. She was going to allow the previous guest to check out late and rely on the guest to change the sheets. It did not work out well. We didn't arrive for check-in until 6pm so it's clear the host was taken advantage of or neither guest nor host can manage their calendars. ",Communication
"BUYER BEWARE this house is listed as an ""entire home"" but there is an older guy that lives upstairs! We were appalled to find someone else walking around in the middle of the night and in the kitchen in the morning considering I was walking around in my sleepwear. Our safety was truly questionable as we had no idea of another guest.Our host was very rude to say the least. She would only communicate with us at 4am and would constantly berate us with convictions and threatened to evict us at 4:30 in the morning because of my service dog. She was very hostile with all her responses and chose to argue with us about the wifi password. It wasn't until the last day of our stay that we received the correct wifi password. We also had trouble with the AC because the man that was staying there turned the air from 69 to 78 every morning around 6AM. ",Communication

"Sylvia worked with us on a very last minute weekend booking. The photos are pretty much spot on. A prime location and good value. Parking was easy, lots of places close by to eat and visit. Burned off all the calories from the Ice Cream Festival by walking to and from Fiesta Gardens :). We didn't go downtown much, but I could see this being a good place to sleep if you plan to drink and not drive. A few small cons, including the cute but a small clawfoot tub (I'm only 5'4"" and I felt a little cramped.) and the fact that things could have been a little cleaner/fresher (crumbs/dirt on the floor, and musty towels). Also, you might want to bring a sleeping mask if you are sensitive to light -- I sleep like a rock but my friend had a hard time with all the ambient light from the windows + light curtains. All in all, a good first experience using AirBnb :) ",Location
"The neighborhood was great and easy to navigate with Uber and walking. We really enjoyed checking out the homes and local businesses nearby. Fiona also provided a great list of restaurants to check out, which was helpful. Unfortunately, the studio itself wasn't very comfortable or clean for our stay. There was a musty smell that clung to our clothes, dust bunnies on the floor, spiderwebs and empty travel toiletries leftover from previous guests in the shower. It was also difficult to get a decent sleep due to the hard mattress and the neighbor's back-to-back parties that lasted until 4 AM on Thursday and Friday nights. Bathroom privacy was hard to come by because there is no door between the toilet and the rest of the studio, just a curtain. I must have missed that in the description. ",Location

"I did not have the best experience in this rental, which is unfortunate because Drew was a great host and the rental itself is perfect in many ways. Unfortunately, the neighbor next door seems to be an enthusiastic smoker of meats. He had at least two smokers that I saw, and they were cooking throughout my visit. As a result, the entire back of Drew's property smelled like smoke, and due to the location of the air conditioner intake, the rental also filled with smoke. When I mentioned the smoke to Drew via text, I returned to find that unit smelled very strongly of peppermint oil, a smell that was also strong when I arrived. The smoke aside, this rental was great. It is in a very nice, quiet neighborhood that offered convenient access to downtown and the university area. The unit itself was clean, well decorated, and well supplied. Though I would not stay here again, it would be and almost perfect rental on weekends when the neighbor is out of town.",Location
"Overall this rental was satisfactory. The pictures are accurate, but to call the unit ""luxurious"" is rather optimistic. Furniture is dated and there are no closets for your clothes. Aside from hand soap and a bottle of body wash there were no extra toiletries (not that we required them). The location is ideal with tons of amenities within walking distance. There is no mention that this unit is on the 3rd floor with no elevator. One of the toilets needed fixing as it ran continuously all night. Wifi was both weak and unreliable, and would drop every few minutes. The unit is described as being in a quiet, residential building. That was not our experience. The majority of people we saw in the other units were in their 20s. I fully recognize Sandeep has no control over the other tenants. I included this because if you are intent on a quiet getaway this may not be the ideal unit for you. Overall, the unit was satisfactory. But I would not stay here again, nor would I recommend this unit to a friend.",Location
"Communication with the host was good, was easy to come and go, there was a bit of an ant problem when I arrived, but they were sure to send an exterminator through and spray in and around the house on the day before I left. The room is as described nothing special, but nice clean comfortable sheets. The bathroom was nice but it is inside the house so a bit inconvenient. I probably would not stay here again, but if you just need cheep place to stay, the house is quite and in a good neighborhood. ",Cleanliness
"Great location for my conference (just across the road). All amenities promised were provided, communication was great and it was a very practical place. If you seek a functional location to base yourself for the city then this is a great option. The accommodation lacks a homey feeling so I would not stay here for a family trip where I would like to spend a lot of time in this apartment.",Location
"I would not stay here. This airbnb was notified of my sister staying with me, and they towed her car! It took 3 hrs and $215 to get it back. Barrett was not remorseful whatsoever and did not offer a reimbursement. I also had to call him more than once to actually get him to give my sister her own parking pass! Ridiculous!",Hospitality
"This place is essentially a hostel which is not clear from the listing. Also the address on the listing is not the address of the place. I felt very misled. KEY INFO: this place is right next door to a nightclub (bed is next to the wall and the nightclub is the other side). It plays loud music (noise and vibrations) until 2:30am Fri and Sat. If you are going to be out at the bars at that time (most close at 2am) this isn't an issue. I had an early flight Sunday so couldn't sleep on Sat. Only two toilets in the whole place so if the place is full (I'd guess 20-30 capacity) be prepared to wait for the restroom. If you want a hostel vibe, there are better ones to go for in Austin. If you want a private room, I'd recommend shelling out a extra $20 a night and stay somewhere better. Loved Austin, but definitely would not stay here again.",Noise
"Location and apartment size was ideal for 3 guests, however, we found the listing to be a bit misleading. Air mattress is moldy and barely stays inflated. Bed is a futon. Couch is great, patio is great, cooking utensils in kitchen are very worn and dirty. Towels smelled of mildew. For our purposes, acl was only about 1.5 mi away and therefore ideal. Aside from that aspect and bos great communication I would not stay here again, or would ask that the listing provided be more accurate in amenities and items provided to guests.",Amenities
"While the room was clean... I would not stay here again. I thought I was staying in an Airbnb. I did not realize I was going to be stalked to go through a tour .. which I was not interested in. There is no security features in this building... even less than a hotel. Doors are always open, no security on elevator to get to room and the door to the lounge and pool was always propped open. If you like the hotel atmosphere.. you would probably like this place_not for me.",Environment
"Personally would not stay here again. Host left out important information from her description that ruined the last day/night of our time in Austin. We noticed cat food in the kitchen when we arrived and became fearful that our allergies would flare up, but I was assured we'd be ok when I reviewed the description and saw this home was not suitable for pets. After relaxing on the couch I noticed lots of pet hair on myself and my boyfriend. By the second night we could barely get any sleep because of an allergic reaction. All of that to say, beware if you have pet allergies. Host admitted a dog staying in the home only after I asked about. Also, pull out couch should not be considered a ""bed"".",Cleanliness
"Not as cute as it appears in pictures. Most everything is old and the house has a mildew smell. We had to go get some Fabreeze to use before we could stay in it. No cable tv. Overall just did not feel fresh and clean. The location is great to get to SoCo and downtown. Quiet neighborhood. Old coffee was in the coffee pot, walls could use a cleaning. We would not stay here again.",Cleanliness
"Great location and a good size for a quick stay. We had some issues getting into the place and we were not able to store our bags at the hotel that was suggested on the website. The morning we left we had an angry neighbor tell us to basically stop walking so he could sleep from the previous night's shift...not the best way to end our stay! The shower is very tiny and my tall husband felt cramped in the bathroom. We enjoyed the record player and being so close to everything, but we would not stay here again given the cost and inconveniences during our stay.",Amenities
"This was our first Airbnb in Austin, so maybe that is the issue, but I would not stay here again. So far, I have never paid more for less. At around $140 after fees and taxes, I would not expect to be asked to removed linens and start the washing machine. Especially considering that the price includes $30 cleaning fee and linens already in the washer and dryer. Also, we were initially sent the entrance info for the wrong house. Luckily we caught the host before she went into her movie or we would have been stuck. Also, despite cleaning up and seeing no dog mess from our dog on our way out, we paid an additional $25 fee for pet hair. $170 for one night, I would have expected a much better experience.",Amenities
"We were disappointed with the communication and cleanliness. We had an average stay, but I would not stay here again. ",Communication
Pros: price- good for two people on a budget looking for a weekend to explore. Late checkout- we got a message the night before we needed to the check out that we could take our time and check out with ease which was very nice. Well stocked - had lots of extra towels and paper towels for use. And had free water bottles for us and wifi. Also left instructions to not clean up after ourselves. Cons: location- it's about a 26 minute walk on dark side street's to south congress which is where restaurants and happening places are. Biggest complaint is that the street is not well lit so if you are coming home late it will be dark and a bit creepy. Bathroom- very small. My husband felt tight and he 160 lbs and 5'8. There was also a bad smell and a bug fell out of my towel. Overall I would not stay here again but if you are on a budget it's good for a weekend. ,Location
"I would NOT stay here again. My friend and I were very disappointed in this AirBNB after staying in others that were far better for the price. It was ran like a grungy motel. The fridge and air were dysfunctional and there were roaches in the house. The floor and bathroom were dirty and there were empty bottles in the shower, like someone lived there. It was also decorated very sparsely and seemed like a makeshift house, rather than an establishment where people are staying. The improvements made on the house were functional ,but looked rushed. Definitely would not pass in a house you want to live in. The owners were never seen, but tried to contact us when we said there were issues. That is not what I want to deal with while on vacation. Worst experience by far on AirBNB.",Cleanliness
"After one night here, we decided to check out early and unfortunately book a hotel. We had the worst night of sleep because of the poor mattress quality. This Airbnb was advertised as having a __tempur-pedic mattress_ However, this is inaccurate _ in fact, its a complete lie. What was advertised as a tempur-pedic mattress is instead an old, uncomfortable and creaky mattress (which sinks in the middle) masked by an old mattress topper. I even checked the mattress myself to confirm this and have photos for record. Also, the pillows are very uncomfortable - neither of them are standard pillows. My wife and I are doing a cross-country road trip with a long drive ahead of us, and cannot risk being sleepless. The host was kind enough to refund us for the unused duration of our stay, which was much appreciated. We love Airbnb and sometimes its a homerun, and other times its a complete miss. This was definitely the latter and we would not stay here again.",Amenities
"Great great location. But definitely felt a bit unsafe bc we didn't have a locked/secured room, so no security at all of our belongings and renter was a bit sketchy.. I hate to judge but he seemed nervous and kinda Socially weird. Also our room was cluttered with his storage. Would not stay here again",Environment
"Ojas is a wonderful host and he has a beautiful property that has been decorated and stocked very thoughtfully to make a guest's stay comfortable. It is a great place if you want to make meals as the kitchen is fully stocked with everything you could want. The location of the house was not great. It is directly across the street from what appeared to be public housing. We checked in after dark and felt uncomfortable with a man that was hanging out at the corner right across from the house. There was also a car parked out in front of the house with it's lights turned on and engine running. It was a very weird situation. We felt so unsafe that we decided to leave for the airport at 5am, several hours before we need to. there was a problem with people ringing the doorbell at midnight on our second night and his response was immediate and he took care of the situation. I feel very bad giving this kind of review, but I did not feel safe and would not stay here again.",Location
"We mostly booked it due to its location and the pool. We stayed here on a really hot week so the pool was a must - that did not disappoint! It was clean + refreshing. Unfortunately, we would not stay here again. The cleanliness is just not up to par. The carpet is really grody and may be due to the fact that there were several dogs in rotation at this apartment. A few of them also barked a good amount. On top of that, the water filter was way past due - and when I went to get ice, the freezer was disgusting. The towels also smell + when you walk into the place there is a definite ""dog"" smell. Finally Gina kept her door unlocked a lot. While this is fine if its just your stuff, our stuff was in the apartment and it made us feel a little unsafe. Fine for one trip - but would not stay here again or recommend. I hardly ever write critical AirBNB reviews + I travel a lot. But I just wish I had dug deeper into these reviews and felt fairly warned before booking.",Cleanliness
"The apartment building is pretty old and reminds you of dorm rooms but once inside the unit the place is perfect for yourself and a few guests. It's off 6th street which can be loud, especially on weekends. We did have a few issues with the apartment and the host. The place had a strict no smoking policy but smelt like someone has smoked in the unit that morning. After removing the bug we thought we'd be okay. We left the apartment and went out for some food. After that, we found another two bugs in the middle of the night in one of the beds. We ended up getting relocated to another unit down the hall. Upon moving to the new room, we ended up discovering another 5-8 bugs throughout the apartment. Another thing to note, is due to the location of the apartment building, you get a very rowdy and loud crowd. Overall, I would not stay here again for obvious reasons mentioned above. If your looking for a grimey apartment on dirty 6th, this is your spot.",Noise
"First, Id like to say that the communication about this reservation has been excellent. Instructions were clear and responses were quick. Second, the location is awesome - walking distance to all that downtown has to offer. Third, the price was very competitive for the size and location. Unfortunately, there was also a huge downside: the apartment itself. In a nutshell, this place is NOT FOR FAMILIES. Here is our list of shortcomings: Blinds flimsy. You can see through them even when all the way rotated. At least one was broken. Then we discovered hairy mold-like stuff growing in the top of the window frame. In the pull out sofa, the mattress was very uncomfortable, you can feel every spring. There were unwashed sheets still on the mattress when we opened it up. Drafty windows. Old, stained mattresses on beds. Silverfish in tub. No soap for the bath. Backed up water in the dishwasher. In sum, this is clearly a rental property that no one cares for as a home. I would not stay here again. ",Cleanliness
"After over two weeks in Airbnbs in Austin we found this one pretty disappointing. We had lots of trouble with the WiFi, the tap water was undrinkable and theres no filter, and the kitchen is lacking a lot of basics. The furniture reminds me of my first apartment, basically whatever I could find on (Hidden by Airbnb) . For the price and compared to all the other great offerings in Austin, this place gets a pass from me. Another made-for-Airbnb apartment that needs much more care to feel like home. Our negative experience aside, Jon and his manager Santi were both great to communicate with and helped us with the WiFi issues we faced as much as they could. Im hopeful that with some more attention this place could be up to par.",Amenities
"Pros: The apartment is in an excellent location and close to Rainey Street. There is a great bar scene and food truck area right outside. If you are looking for a fun nightlife experience, this is a perfect spot! Cons: The check-in process was a nightmare and very stressful to get things sorted. This Airbnb is manage by a 3rd party company and the communication experience felt very non personal. You have to use an app for the apartment code and another app for parking - not easy! I felt that I was reading a confusing novel to figure out how to check-in. Even though I registered my rental car with the app, I still got towed and this Airbnb wont pay for my $214 towing fee. They couldn't even verify if my rental car was registered upon check-in to avoid any towing mishaps. Overall: I'm not a fan of this Airbnb experience and would look for another Airbnb in Austin next time. Getting towed and having a poor check-in experience was not fun on vacation. ",Hospitality
