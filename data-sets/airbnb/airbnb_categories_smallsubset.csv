"On this visit, I noticed amenities that had been there before, but we just did not see. There were tea and hot cocoa pouches with mints, cups, and even fresh fruit, like a classy hotel. Sadly, somebody else booked additional days I wanted.",Amenities
"Elizabeth was an excellent host! We felt welcomed and comfortable the moment we entered her home. She even left amenities for us, including guides to what was nearby and a map of Austin which was very helpful. The house was in a safe location and it was easy to get to downtown. We would absolutely recommend Elizabeth to anyone who needs a place to stay in Austin.",Amenities
What a pleasant surprise it was to have such a lovely room to stay in with all of the amenities! It was great visiting with the host family and getting to know them as well. Elizabeth was quick to answer my calls and texts and readily communicated without a problem. Looking forward to the next time I'm in that neck of the woods so I can stay again.,Amenities
"A true gem, close to the city centre of Austin. A safe, quiet and beautiful area. The house is clean and has everything you need including dish washer, washing machine and dryer. Comfortable beds. I highly recommend this place. ",Amenities
"Location:Very secluded even though the highway is so close. You pull into a private residential street and then pull into their even more private tree-lined driveway. Very nice peaceful stay. If you need to keep in touch with the hosts, their house is just further down the driveway. On site hiking paths was awesome. Probably would've braved going down the trails more had I had better shoes. The whole property in general looks like an artistic public garden, a hidden jewel. We ended up bringing our car, which makes it easier to travel around and get things that we needed. Amenities:Modern decor, cute breakfast nook, fruits, pastry, snacks, water bottles, coffee/creamer, cups/plates/bowls, extra blankets, books/magazines about Austin, plus all the things you would expect from a hotel except better. They even provided things you didn't expect (like a colander!) but it was a pleasant surprise and we made use of these items.",Amenities
"Our view of this accommodation is quite different to others, maybe it's all about expectation. We have been traveling for about a month and this place was the most lacking in modern conveniences. No cable TV (CNN, HBO, Disney JR), no dish washer, no clothes washer/drier, water heater couldn't handle 2 consecutive showers and water pressure is rather low. It's almost 20 km to the Hamilton Pools (pictured with the listing). Interior design was tasteful but rooms are dark. ",Amenities
"Not what I expected. The house is very small. It wasn't a terrible place to stay but here are a couple issues to be aware of. WiFi isn't good in the bedroom, there isn't a tv in the bedroom, the bedroom ISNT private the door opens easily and doesn't lock none of the doors lock, and they kept changing the temperature to a high temperature. Ok good things though include: peaceful place to be, clean, and good accommodations such as towlels, bedding, and blankets.",Amenities
"My stay here was okay. The host responded quickly through Airbnb messaging, but wasn't very helpful in answering my questions. There was no hair dryer and the host did not provide one upon request. Also, there was a french fry on the floor of my room the first day I moved in. No one came to take out the trash for days. There were also a bunch of dirty dishes in the dish washer for days. House keeping came in on one day and only stayed about 30 minutes to clean. I guess you get what you pay for. The amenities are minimal, but overall my stay wasn't bad. ",Cleanliness
"Librada met us the moment we arrived, helped us settle in, and made sure we had everything we needed -- from the wifi password to fresh towels to coffee and creamer for the next morning. The neighborhood was gorgeous and nicely situated -- near popular spots like South Lamar, South Congress, Barton Springs Pool and Zilker Park -- and the space was perfect for our needs. The cabin is nestled in a little forest of bamboo, making it super dreamy and very serene. ",Amenities
"We came to Austin to attend our daughter's graduation from UT and stayed at Shelley & Carl's bungalow. It was everything we wanted: a bungalow in a quiet shady backyard with a very pleasant garden close to our daughter's apt. in Hyde Park. Perfect for two people. They had the fridge stocked with all kinds of beverages plus fixings for an oatmeal breakfast and several kinds of coffee. The bed was comfortable and there was enough hot water for my wife and I. The bungalow had a sitting area with a tv equipped with Roku and a love seat; the walls are decorated with Swiss skiing posters (from the 50s?). The wifi connection was fast, too. We had a post graduation celebration--including playing bocce--at the bungalow and they were very accommodating to us. They were very friendly and helpful; I hope we have the chance to visit again.",Amenities
"We had a great time in Austin staying at Paddy's house. The house is much larger than it looks on the photos, very clean and the moment you step in you feel like home. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again next time I'm back in Austin. ",Cleanliness
"I arrived late in the evening so did not meet Paddy, but her home was lovely and clean and welcoming. She checked in with my friend and I most days to make sure that we had no questions or needed anything. All in all, a very smooth, stress-free experience in Austin!",Cleanliness
"As always, clean, cozy and neat. I love this place. ",Cleanliness
"How do you spell disappointment.I stayed at this location two years ago & thats why I decided to stay again.First of all the minute you walked in there was a stench that I could not figure what it was until the next morning when the cat was at the front door waiting to come in...it was obvious by this cats refusal to go away that he/she was familiar with coming inside.So then it hit me what that smell (Website hidden by Airbnb) great if you are a cat lover and don't mind smelling cat urine.Second, if you leave blankets around, don't leave the ones with blood on them.And how about putting a mattress cover on the mattress. Will never stay here again..and would not recommend anyone to stay there either.",Cleanliness
I would not recommend renting any house from this host because the house he rents out they are unsanitary the bed the couch carpet walls they were all dirty I question the The Host he said we are germophobic if we wanted cleaner house we should pay more. So we left and checked in to local hotel. ,Cleanliness
Cozy and well-located. High marks for cleanliness. I have no negative to report. Would certainly reserve this backhouse again- the chickens even grew less wary of this traveler.,Cleanliness
"I don't love leaving negative reviews, but this was disappointing at best. The neighborhood is so Austin kooky, and the studio itself, though pretty rustic, has a cool funky vibe. But the black mold we found under the toilet seat, the grime we wiped out of the shower, the two-inch roach we killed, and the extraordinarily uncomfortable bed made us feel like we'd been swindled. I wouldn't let a friend stay there for free in its present state.",Cleanliness
"The bedrooms were extremely cluttered with boxes and duffle bags; closets were full of boxes, books, and an extra mattress; other personal items cluttered up the living room and there was leftover food in the fridge. While the apartment appeared to have clean sheets and a plethora of clean towels, the apartment was not nearly as clean as a hotel would be. There was a layer of dust on most of the furniture. The worst offense though was that the showers were not cleaned and he left considerable amounts of bath products in them such as loofahs and a squeegee. All of this could be fixed by a good scrub from professional cleaners. While east Austin was definitely walkable from the apartment, it was farther than we had expected based on the write up (and not something you'd want to do in heels!). The write up of the apartment was misleading in other ways. The write up proclaims that there is a fully stocked beer fridge, but fails to mention it is not for visitor use. ",Cleanliness
"Not as cute as it appears in pictures. Most everything is old and the house has a mildew smell. We had to go get some Fabreeze to use before we could stay in it. No cable tv. Overall just did not feel fresh and clean. The location is great to get to SoCo and downtown. Quiet neighborhood. Old coffee was in the coffee pot, walls could use a cleaning. We would not stay here again.",Cleanliness
"I would NOT stay here again. My friend and I were very disappointed in this AirBNB after staying in others that were far better for the price. It was ran like a grungy motel. The fridge and air were dysfunctional and there were roaches in the house. The floor and bathroom were dirty and there were empty bottles in the shower, like someone lived there. It was also decorated very sparsely and seemed like a makeshift house, rather than an establishment where people are staying. The improvements made on the house were functional ,but looked rushed. Definitely would not pass in a house you want to live in. The owners were never seen, but tried to contact us when we said there were issues. That is not what I want to deal with while on vacation. Worst experience by far on AirBNB.",Cleanliness
"We mostly booked it due to its location and the pool. We stayed here on a really hot week so the pool was a must - that did not disappoint! It was clean + refreshing. Unfortunately, we would not stay here again. The cleanliness is just not up to par. The carpet is really grody and may be due to the fact that there were several dogs in rotation at this apartment. A few of them also barked a good amount. On top of that, the water filter was way past due - and when I went to get ice, the freezer was disgusting. The towels also smell + when you walk into the place there is a definite ""dog"" smell. Finally Gina kept her door unlocked a lot. While this is fine if its just your stuff, our stuff was in the apartment and it made us feel a little unsafe. Fine for one trip - but would not stay here again or recommend. I hardly ever write critical AirBNB reviews + I travel a lot. But I just wish I had dug deeper into these reviews and felt fairly warned before booking.",Cleanliness
"Crystal was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. We stayed here for my wedding weekend and it was perfect for our group. We even got ready at the house and had plenty of space. The house is nicely decorated and clean. We really appreciated being able to use the 2 car garage as well. The only con is that there is a bar directly behind the house that plays loud music until about 2 am. Other than that, we loved our stay and would highly recommend it for others!",Noise
"I really enjoy the boutique hotel experience, and Susan and Anthony have created a space with all the perks of a boutique hotel but with the added advantage of being in a very lovely, quiet neighborhood. I did need to ask some questions/ request something, and the communication was always fast and helpful. My request was accommodated, no problem. I'm not sure a hotel would have done so. Here are some of the things I loved: the Japanese bath (the entire bathroom was sparkly clean), the sheets, the above and beyond comfy mattress, and the supply of ear plugs (I was attending a music fest). The walk around to the apartment reminded me a bit of a spa I've been to in New Mexico, even with the faintest, most relaxing sound of crickets.",Amenities
"It's a beautiful, spacious and cozy condo. It is well equipped with the basics such as the washer dryer, dish washer, TV, basic bathroom linen/toiletries etc. Very comfortable place. The building is at a great location! Great food and theaters, groceries etc at walkable distance. Gym and pool and coffee in the lobby are great additions! I had a great time. ",Amenities
"Overall, a spectacular experience. The only slight downside was that it was a hike to get into downtown Austin, but certainly not insurmountable with a rental car/uber.The pluses way outweighed the location! The big 2 positives were the airstream itself, and the ridiculous hospitality of the Shannons.The airstream itself was super nice - a blend of vintage style and modern amenities. There's a fridge, dish washer, fully stocked kitchen, TV w/ cable, a big nice bed, a porch with great lighting for evening drinks. Everything was nice and worked well.The hospitality was on the next level. The Shannons left us a bottle of tequila and cocktail ingredients, coffee, cereal, local milk in glass bottles, candy.... Most impressively, on morning one we woke up to a tray left on our front porch with delicious breakfast tacos and OJ. Couldn't have nicer things to say about the Shannons, who felt like old friends who were letting my girlfriend and I stay with them on their property. ",Amenities
"We had a great stay at Zen East for South By Southwest! Paddy was extremely accommodating and we found the place to be exotic and homely. It was easy to settle right in and experience Austin, and everything was a short taxi or bus ride away. She had everything we needed for our stay, and we loved the zen vibe of the backyard garden. ",Hospitality
"Very nice, took me to the co-op healthy grocery and gave rides when possible. Has a sweet little dog and a lovely home to share.",Hospitality
"Paddy was very professional but also friendly. The house was lovely, the location was really perfect, and her dog Diego is very cute.",Hospitality
Paddy couldn't have been a more accommodating host. Her place was comfortable and near the rail line for quick access to downtown. All and all it was a great place to stay.,Hospitality
"I had a very pleasant stay in Austin and Paddy was quite friendly and helpful. She helped me find some places in the neighborhood (which I enjoyed staying in), and her place was like a relaxing oasis. I would definitely stay here again.",Hospitality
"Let me start off by saying that Elizabeth and David are amazing people to get to know, they are very helpful and are great hosts! The area in NW is peaceful, the house is beautiful and cozy and I love the backyard. I will highly recommend my family and friends and anyone to stay with them while visiting Austin. ",Hospitality
I enjoyed my brief stay and hope to visit again-this time longer. They took care of all the little details and I felt very welcomed. ,Hospitality
"Had a great stay. David and Elizabeth are very accommodating and kind. Was not my first stay here, and I would definitely stay again.",Hospitality
"Elizabeth and Dave (and their dog Donny) were AWESOME! They were very friendly and accomodating and they truly made me feel at home. They even invited me to hang out with them and eat dinner with them. (Side note: Elizabeth is an amazing cook!) As for the room, it was very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and it wasn't too far from the downtown area. I would definitely stay here again and I would recommend this place to friends and family traveling to the Austin area. The price is right, the location is ideal, and the hosts are amazing. ",Hospitality
Nate's home is perfect for staying close to downtown Austin. His place is very clean and comfortable. The room felt just like staying in a hotel with a little refrigerator and coffee machine. He was more than gracious and easy to communicate with. I would definitely recommend his place as it definitely exceeded my expectations. A++,Hospitality
"Great place, close enough to everything downtown Austin has, yet just far enough to be relaxing and quiet. An excellent place to regroup and recharge. Paddy respected my privacy and different hours. The place is clean and hip - I would stay with Paddy again. You must be okay with dogs. ",Location
"Erik and Crystal's place is right in the center of downtown Austin, which makes it perfect walking distance to everything. Erik was a great host who's easily contacted and accommodating to all his guests. Could not recommend this place anymore to someone visiting Austin for the first time like myself.",Location
The condo is in a great location.,Location
"We really enjoyed staying here for our recent bachelor party of 8 guys in Austin. It is in a perfect location that is walkable to all of the happening places downtown. It is a clean, modern condo with very convenient access thanks to the key code doorlock. The only negatives were:- This is an 8 person place, not 10. There are 3 king beds and a pull out. I do not have any idea where you sleep 2 more people. - A couple little things like no bathroom vent fans (a big problem with 8 dudes eating BBQ and drinking beer) and the TV not working very well.Overall it was a great place to stay and I would definitely stay there again.",Location
"The location of the apartment is very convenient and closely located to the 6th st, Rainey and Congress. However, the price during the weekend is way to high in comparison to other properties. ",Location
Perfect location-- close to downtown and located in a safe complex. Would highly recommend to others looking for a place to stay while visiting Austin.,Location
Within a few miles of everywhere you want to be.,Location
Nice home in a quiet neighborhood. Very hospitable. Extremely comfortable bed. Would stay here again.,Noise
The place is as described. The house is in a quiet and safe location. Elizabeth and David were great hosts. She was also very helpful to me during my search for a place to live as I am new to the area.,Noise
Nice place in a quiet neighborhood. Would highly recommend. Host was very helpful in making sure we were comfortable. ,Noise
Overall we enjoyed our stay. The host did mention in the check-in instruction that voices in the hallway carry easily through the windows so I'd encourage any guest to bring ear plugs and eye mask. (We stayed over the mardi gras weekend.) The unit is on 3rd floor in an apt/condo complex with secured gates. Location is very safe and convenient where there are great restaurants and bars within walking distance. Our self check-in was easy and had enough towels to use. We also enjoyed ESPN channels.,Noise
"description of listing is accurate. RIGHT next to the convention center. Everything was great but I would recommend bringing ear plugs if you like to sleep in ""silence"" because you can hear people walking by on the street or outside of the apt. ",Noise
"Perfect downtown location, place was nice if a little basic and unfortunately surroundings were very loud! ",Noise
"No real issues. Place is clean and nice and well-maintained. Easy to access. Great, super convenient location. Parking isn't really an issue, either; plenty available nearby.Only negative thing is that it can be a little loud if it's a holiday / busy weekend in one of the bedrooms, due to the fact that it faces the street. Chalk it up to being near everything. ",Noise
"The check in at Jenny's was very easy. The air conditioning worked very well and the bed was super comfy. It was an easy walk to Downtown Austin. The construction was loud, but Jenny had told us about it. It was quiet at night.",Noise
