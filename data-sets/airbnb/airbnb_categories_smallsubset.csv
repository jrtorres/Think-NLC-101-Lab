"On this visit, I noticed amenities that had been there before, but we just did not see. There were tea and hot cocoa pouches with mints, cups, and even fresh fruit, like a classy hotel. Sadly, somebody else booked additional days I wanted.",Amenities
"Elizabeth was an excellent host! We felt welcomed and comfortable the moment we entered her home. She even left amenities for us, including guides to what was nearby and a map of Austin which was very helpful. The house was in a safe location and it was easy to get to downtown. We would absolutely recommend Elizabeth to anyone who needs a place to stay in Austin.",Amenities
"What a pleasant surprise it was to have such a lovely room to stay in with all of the amenities! It was great visiting with the host family and getting to know them as well. Elizabeth was quick to answer my calls and texts and readily communicated without a problem. Looking forward to the next time I'm in that neck of the woods so I can stay again.",Amenities
"We recently stayed in Sarah's cottage, and while there are some very nice things about it, sadly our experience wasn't as overwhelmingly positive as everyone else's. Positives: the cottage is cute and nicely decorated, with a really nice bathroom (great shower!) and a comfortable bed. It's also quiet, well located and with easy access to the rest of Austin and beyond. Negatives: the WIFI is almost non existent. When we did manage to connect, the signal was so weak it took a long time to load just a single page. As international travellers who can't use data while roaming and rely on free WIFI, this was very frustrating, especially as the property is advertised as having internet. The cottage could also do with some dusting / cleaning. It wasn't too bad (the main things, i.e. bathroom / bed were clean) but things like the fridge, shelves, floor etc. needed some attention. And finally, we also found the host unresponsive and not particularly helpful. ",Amenities
"I never met Sara. The only communication was text messages wanting to know whether we could leave early on thanksgiving so it could be cleaned for next guests. Perhaps she was gone. The house was in a quiet backyard with trees, close to my daughter and the cherrywood coffeehouse where we went everyday. The bed was really really comfortable.The only problems we had were an electric plug near the bed that didn't work and the refrigerator froze all our food even tho it was turned down low. ",Amenities
"A true gem, close to the city centre of Austin. A safe, quiet and beautiful area. The house is clean and has everything you need including dish washer, washing machine and dryer. Comfortable beds. I highly recommend this place. ",Amenities
"Location:Very secluded even though the highway is so close. You pull into a private residential street and then pull into their even more private tree-lined driveway. Very nice peaceful stay. If you need to keep in touch with the hosts, their house is just further down the driveway. On site hiking paths was awesome. Probably would've braved going down the trails more had I had better shoes. The whole property in general looks like an artistic public garden, a hidden jewel. We ended up bringing our car, which makes it easier to travel around and get things that we needed. Amenities:Modern decor, cute breakfast nook, fruits, pastry, snacks, water bottles, coffee/creamer, cups/plates/bowls, extra blankets, books/magazines about Austin, plus all the things you would expect from a hotel except better. They even provided things you didn't expect (like a colander!) but it was a pleasant surprise and we made use of these items.",Amenities
"We planned to stay for four nights and left after one due to feeling unsafe and uncomfortable. The unit is very rundown, and photos and listing description are inaccurate and outdated. Unit does not have a pullout sofa or chairs in dining area that are in the photo. Multiple safety and comfort issues: this is a ground floor unit and the windows were unlocked on arrival and difficult to lock due to broken lock mechanisms, very difficult to find the parking spot, had to unload the dishwasher of previous guest, lack of toilet paper, moderate amount of mold on shower curtain, ceiling lights in bedroom not all functional, multiple table lamps with either missing lightbulbs or burnt out, main bed and pillows not comfortable, shower temperature extremely difficult to control (scalding or too cool), 4-inch cockroach in the bathroom, AC vent above main bedroom door loose and noisy. Plus, the host expects that you load the dishwasher, start laundry, and take out the garbage even though there is an $80 cleaning fee. ",Amenities
"Our view of this accommodation is quite different to others, maybe it's all about expectation. We have been traveling for about a month and this place was the most lacking in modern conveniences. No cable TV (CNN, HBO, Disney JR), no dish washer, no clothes washer/drier, water heater couldn't handle 2 consecutive showers and water pressure is rather low. It's almost 20 km to the Hamilton Pools (pictured with the listing). Interior design was tasteful but rooms are dark. ",Amenities
"My family had to vacate this house after the AC failed in on a 100 degree day in July. I was unimpressed by Top Trip's efforts at fixing the AC, which wasted a whole day of our vacation. My and family and I will not stay at any of Top Trip's properties in the future because of this frustrating experience.The house itself was neither wonderful nor bad, merely meh in a way that would have rendered our stay there an entirely forgettable aspect of our vacation. It is located very close to attractions in South Austin that are enjoyable for adults, children and dogs alike. It has a nice back porch that is a pleasant spot for enjoying an evening breeze. Judging from other property reviews, Top Trip seems capable of addressing minor issues like an empty propane tank in the grill outside.They are not, however, ready to address a real issue like a failed AC unit on a Saturday night. ",Amenities
"Not what I expected. The house is very small. It wasn't a terrible place to stay but here are a couple issues to be aware of. WiFi isn't good in the bedroom, there isn't a tv in the bedroom, the bedroom ISNT private the door opens easily and doesn't lock none of the doors lock, and they kept changing the temperature to a high temperature. Ok good things though include: peaceful place to be, clean, and good accommodations such as towlels, bedding, and blankets.",Amenities
"My stay here was okay. The host responded quickly through Airbnb messaging, but wasn't very helpful in answering my questions. There was no hair dryer and the host did not provide one upon request. Also, there was a french fry on the floor of my room the first day I moved in. No one came to take out the trash for days. There were also a bunch of dirty dishes in the dish washer for days. House keeping came in on one day and only stayed about 30 minutes to clean. I guess you get what you pay for. The amenities are minimal, but overall my stay wasn't bad. ",Amenities
"Librada met us the moment we arrived, helped us settle in, and made sure we had everything we needed -- from the wifi password to fresh towels to coffee and creamer for the next morning. The neighborhood was gorgeous and nicely situated -- near popular spots like South Lamar, South Congress, Barton Springs Pool and Zilker Park -- and the space was perfect for our needs. The cabin is nestled in a little forest of bamboo, making it super dreamy and very serene. ",Amenities
"We came to Austin to attend our daughter's graduation from UT and stayed at Shelley & Carl's bungalow. It was everything we wanted: a bungalow in a quiet shady backyard with a very pleasant garden close to our daughter's apt. in Hyde Park. Perfect for two people. They had the fridge stocked with all kinds of beverages plus fixings for an oatmeal breakfast and several kinds of coffee. The bed was comfortable and there was enough hot water for my wife and I. The bungalow had a sitting area with a tv equipped with Roku and a love seat; the walls are decorated with Swiss skiing posters (from the 50s?). The wifi connection was fast, too. We had a post graduation celebration--including playing bocce--at the bungalow and they were very accommodating to us. They were very friendly and helpful; I hope we have the chance to visit again.",Amenities
"We would not recommend this house for families. The backyard was definitely not kid friendly. There were no stoppers in the tubs in order to bathe children. There was no kitchen disposal, so if one wanted to cook, that would be a consideration.",Amenities
"We had a great time in Austin staying at Paddy's house. The house is much larger than it looks on the photos, very clean and the moment you step in you feel like home. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again next time I'm back in Austin. ",Cleanliness
"I arrived late in the evening so did not meet Paddy, but her home was lovely and clean and welcoming. She checked in with my friend and I most days to make sure that we had no questions or needed anything. All in all, a very smooth, stress-free experience in Austin!",Cleanliness
"As always, clean, cozy and neat. I love this place. ",Cleanliness
"I enjoyed meeting my hosts when I arrived around dinnertime. They were very gracious in responding to my text message that indicated I was running an hour behind the agreed upon time. I found their home welcoming, and the room provided for me safe, comfortable, and inviting. The instructions were clearly stated. I had a wonderful stay!",Cleanliness
"How do you spell disappointment.I stayed at this location two years ago & thats why I decided to stay again.First of all the minute you walked in there was a stench that I could not figure what it was until the next morning when the cat was at the front door waiting to come in...it was obvious by this cats refusal to go away that he/she was familiar with coming inside.So then it hit me what that smell (Website hidden by Airbnb) great if you are a cat lover and don't mind smelling cat urine.Second, if you leave blankets around, don't leave the ones with blood on them.And how about putting a mattress cover on the mattress. Will never stay here again..and would not recommend anyone to stay there either.",Cleanliness
I would not recommend renting any house from this host because the house he rents out they are unsanitary the bed the couch carpet walls they were all dirty I question the The Host he said we are germophobic if we wanted cleaner house we should pay more. So we left and checked in to local hotel. ,Cleanliness
Very good house with an even better host. Offered us another house when one of our colleagues developed allergies in the house and was very friendly and fast in all answers,Cleanliness
Cozy and well-located. High marks for cleanliness. I have no negative to report. Would certainly reserve this backhouse again- the chickens even grew less wary of this traveler.,Cleanliness
"I don't love leaving negative reviews, but this was disappointing at best. The neighborhood is so Austin kooky, and the studio itself, though pretty rustic, has a cool funky vibe. But the black mold we found under the toilet seat, the grime we wiped out of the shower, the two-inch roach we killed, and the extraordinarily uncomfortable bed made us feel like we'd been swindled. I wouldn't let a friend stay there for free in its present state.",Cleanliness
"The Birdhouse was exactly as described. It was simple and convenient for two of us who mostly just needed and affordable place to sleep and shower as we adventures around the city. We loved the neighborhood and although we only saw Elizabeth once, she was very friendly. ",Cleanliness
"The bedrooms were extremely cluttered with boxes and duffle bags; closets were full of boxes, books, and an extra mattress; other personal items cluttered up the living room and there was leftover food in the fridge. While the apartment appeared to have clean sheets and a plethora of clean towels, the apartment was not nearly as clean as a hotel would be. There was a layer of dust on most of the furniture. The worst offense though was that the showers were not cleaned and he left considerable amounts of bath products in them such as loofahs and a squeegee. All of this could be fixed by a good scrub from professional cleaners. While east Austin was definitely walkable from the apartment, it was farther than we had expected based on the write up (and not something you'd want to do in heels!). The write up of the apartment was misleading in other ways. The write up proclaims that there is a fully stocked beer fridge, but fails to mention it is not for visitor use. ",Cleanliness
"Personally would not stay here again. Host left out important information from her description that ruined the last day/night of our time in Austin. We noticed cat food in the kitchen when we arrived and became fearful that our allergies would flare up, but I was assured we'd be ok when I reviewed the description and saw this home was not suitable for pets. After relaxing on the couch I noticed lots of pet hair on myself and my boyfriend. By the second night we could barely get any sleep because of an allergic reaction. All of that to say, beware if you have pet allergies. Host admitted a dog staying in the home only after I asked about. Also, pull out couch should not be considered a ""bed"".",Cleanliness
"Not as cute as it appears in pictures. Most everything is old and the house has a mildew smell. We had to go get some Fabreeze to use before we could stay in it. No cable tv. Overall just did not feel fresh and clean. The location is great to get to SoCo and downtown. Quiet neighborhood. Old coffee was in the coffee pot, walls could use a cleaning. We would not stay here again.",Cleanliness
"I would NOT stay here again. My friend and I were very disappointed in this AirBNB after staying in others that were far better for the price. It was ran like a grungy motel. The fridge and air were dysfunctional and there were roaches in the house. The floor and bathroom were dirty and there were empty bottles in the shower, like someone lived there. It was also decorated very sparsely and seemed like a makeshift house, rather than an establishment where people are staying. The improvements made on the house were functional ,but looked rushed. Definitely would not pass in a house you want to live in. The owners were never seen, but tried to contact us when we said there were issues. That is not what I want to deal with while on vacation. Worst experience by far on AirBNB.",Cleanliness
"We mostly booked it due to its location and the pool. We stayed here on a really hot week so the pool was a must - that did not disappoint! It was clean + refreshing. Unfortunately, we would not stay here again. The cleanliness is just not up to par. The carpet is really grody and may be due to the fact that there were several dogs in rotation at this apartment. A few of them also barked a good amount. On top of that, the water filter was way past due - and when I went to get ice, the freezer was disgusting. The towels also smell + when you walk into the place there is a definite ""dog"" smell. Finally Gina kept her door unlocked a lot. While this is fine if its just your stuff, our stuff was in the apartment and it made us feel a little unsafe. Fine for one trip - but would not stay here again or recommend. I hardly ever write critical AirBNB reviews + I travel a lot. But I just wish I had dug deeper into these reviews and felt fairly warned before booking.",Cleanliness
"I didn't have the opportunity to meet Elizabeth, but the communication was very good and she made us feel so welcome even without her physical presence. The house is beautiful, comfortable, and very clean as well. I was amazed by how much care she took in making the guests feel so welcome and taken care of. The room was filled with so many amenities, including a microwave, coffee, tea, protein bars, lotions, shampoos, all kinds of different things. A very pleasant stay, even though I only spent one night there. I would definitely come back again. ",Communication
Susan is a fantastic host. Great communication. Lovely neighborhood. Short drive away from all the popular tourist sites. Highly recommend!,Communication
"Susan made me feel welcome from the moment that my reservation was accepted, and that continued throughout my stay. Shortly after the reservation was confirmed I received the very comprehensive stay details that I needed to be prepared for my arrival and check-in. As I learned after I arrived, her description of the apartment was just as accurate as the online description and photos that were provided. Arrival and check-in was smooth and effortless, and the apt. had all of the amenities that one might expect and then some. From the Nespresso teas and coffees, flavored waters, microwave and refrigerator to the more than adequate toiletries, Susan seemed to have thought of everything that the traveler might need. The unit was clean, the bed very comfortable, the air conditioning great even with 100-plus degree days. Located in a very pretty, quiet neighborhood, I won't hesitate to book here again. Thanks to Susan and her husband for providing a true ""home away from home"".",Communication
Wonderfully communicative and warm.,Communication
"It sounded like something must have been broken. We sent Brock a courtesy note through the Airbnb app then around 11pm, letting him know he may want to check it out.The response was quite surprising, and felt aggressive. At 3:40am we received a message back asking if we'd ever heard a washing machine before. 10-20 minutes later, another message saying that if it bothered me so much I could use the on site pay machines (even though laundry is listed as an amenity at his location). And even went on to say, «è_«è_«è_Wanna know what my complaint is? Getting woken up at 11:30 on a Monday about a loud washing machine. Poor you.«è_„ùWe were very taken aback by his approach, and tried to de-escalate the situation. To this, he ended up responding again in the morning (in a seemingly more calm manner) that he would have a look after we checked out after our stay. After such an alarming response, we didn't know what to do. So we left it at that, and feel right that futures guests should be aware .",Communication
"Crystal was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. We stayed here for my wedding weekend and it was perfect for our group. We even got ready at the house and had plenty of space. The house is nicely decorated and clean. We really appreciated being able to use the 2 car garage as well. The only con is that there is a bar directly behind the house that plays loud music until about 2 am. Other than that, we loved our stay and would highly recommend it for others!",Communication
"Niki & Veronica's house is one of the best places I've stayed in. The Airbnb photos accurately capture the essence and feel for their house. Niki & Veronica were very communicative and friendly.

We'll be adding Niki & Veronica's house to our list of candidates when we return to Austin.",Communication

Everything about our stay was terrific -- the condo is clean, outfitted with everything you need (dishes, cookware, towels, wifi, space!), and has a great vintage/retro vibe. It's located in a quiet and peaceful residential neighborhoods, but is within walking distance to all the SOCO shops and eateries and an easy drive to everything else in Austin. We were really pleased with our stay -- highly recommended!",Environment
"I really enjoy the boutique hotel experience, and Susan and Anthony have created a space with all the perks of a boutique hotel but with the added advantage of being in a very lovely, quiet neighborhood. I did need to ask some questions/ request something, and the communication was always fast and helpful. My request was accommodated, no problem. I'm not sure a hotel would have done so. Here are some of the things I loved: the Japanese bath (the entire bathroom was sparkly clean), the sheets, the above and beyond comfy mattress, and the supply of ear plugs (I was attending a music fest). The walk around to the apartment reminded me a bit of a spa I've been to in New Mexico, even with the faintest, most relaxing sound of crickets.",Environment
"Susan was an extraordinary host. The house is a beautiful contemporary home in a beautiful, leafy neighborhood filled with gorgeous homes. The unit itself is filled with very nice high-end linens. There are so many lovely touches: decorating, having everything we needed at hand.

If we return to Austin, we will stay with her again!",Environment
"Indeed, the place is a funky, artsy space that was comfortable, clean and safe. The neighborhood is interesting and Sevylla's place is super close to Onnit Academy/Gym so it's a great place to stay if you're taking a certification course there. Easy access to the freeway and a quick jaunt to all the cool places in the downtown area without being in the hustle and bustle of the city. The neighbors have roosters, so it's a good idea to have ear plugs.",Environment
"The studio is funky and hip, a great place to stay only a short drive from downtown. This place is a Super gem. The neighborhood is very family-friendly so don't expect lots of party noises, although the roosters in the neighborhood might wake you up if you're a light sleeper, so bring some earplugs. Personally I really enjoyed the environment and all of the unique birds (greckles, starlings, roosters and chickens). If you want to take the bus, it goes right by the front door. This was my second visit to Sevylla's Studio and I will definitely be coming back for my next trip to Austin",Environment
Absolutely ADORED this camper! Super cozy and stylish! We had everything we needed and more. Loved seeing the neighbor's cats since they were so friendly. One of my favorite things was the outdoor shower... Try to shower at night if you can to catch a glimpse of the stars :) Would definitely recommend and will be staying again next time I'm in Austin!,Environment
"It's a beautiful, spacious and cozy condo. It is well equipped with the basics such as the washer dryer, dish washer, TV, basic bathroom linen/toiletries etc. Very comfortable place. The building is at a great location! Great food and theaters, groceries etc at walkable distance. Gym and pool and coffee in the lobby are great additions! I had a great time. ",Environment
"Overall, a spectacular experience. The only slight downside was that it was a hike to get into downtown Austin, but certainly not insurmountable with a rental car/uber.The pluses way outweighed the location! The big 2 positives were the airstream itself, and the ridiculous hospitality of the Shannons.The airstream itself was super nice - a blend of vintage style and modern amenities. There's a fridge, dish washer, fully stocked kitchen, TV w/ cable, a big nice bed, a porch with great lighting for evening drinks. Everything was nice and worked well.The hospitality was on the next level. The Shannons left us a bottle of tequila and cocktail ingredients, coffee, cereal, local milk in glass bottles, candy.... Most impressively, on morning one we woke up to a tray left on our front porch with delicious breakfast tacos and OJ. Couldn't have nicer things to say about the Shannons, who felt like old friends who were letting my girlfriend and I stay with them on their property. ",Environment
"We had a great stay at Zen East for South By Southwest! Paddy was extremely accommodating and we found the place to be exotic and homely.

"Paddy's home is charming and she is a very gracious host. She was kind enough to walk me around the neighborhood and make me feel at home.\r\r\r\rAt first I thought the location was a bit far from downtown, but there's a bus route that is a mere 2-blocks from her house and it takes all of 10-minutes to get to The Capital. Biking in the area is great too; it's about a 15-minute bike ride to/from Downtown. Paddy was kind enough to drive me to a bike rental shop.\r\r\r\rThe neighborhood is a bit eclectic with a mixture of Austin locals, artists and activists. I was fortunate to be there the same weekend as East Austin Studio Tours (EAST), which gave me a chance to explore that section of Austin. Paddy & I went to an outdoor performance that was a few blocks from her home, which was fantastic.\r\r\r\rPS: Diego is a cutie.",Hospitality
Paddy couldn't have been a more accommodating host. Her place was comfortable and near the rail line for quick access to downtown. All and all it was a great place to stay.,Hospitality

There were little custom touches all over the bungalow, it was so clean and well-kept, and the small kitchen off the side was adorable and really nice to have. Also VERY central to everything in the city. Couldn't recommend this place more!!!",Hospitality
Nate's home is perfect for staying close to downtown Austin. His place is very clean and comfortable. The room felt just like staying in a hotel with a little refrigerator and coffee machine.

"Our top 5 reasons you'll want to stay here and nowhere else: Location - 15 minutes via rental car to downtown, 1 hr 20 min to San Antonio (must make the side trip!) and less than 3 hours from Dallas for ease of flights. Meticulously cleaned and organized in the flat. Everything you need for cooking (small countertop burner), fridge, dishware and more. Folder and guidebook left in the unit for planning activities, and an additional e-mail from Drew with local favorites. Privacy. We would see Drew and Simone in passing, and it felt like saying hello to neighbors. Very comfortable and private entrance into the flat, noise was never an issue.4. Water pressure in the shower. If you travel often, you know how important a good shower is. While slightly tight for two adults, the shower is well built into the private bath off the flat. ",Location

"We really enjoyed staying here for our recent bachelor party of 8 guys in Austin. It is in a perfect location that is walkable to all of the happening places downtown. It is a clean, modern condo with very convenient access thanks to the key code doorlock. The only negatives were:- This is an 8 person place, not 10. There are 3 king beds and a pull out. I do not have any idea where you sleep 2 more people. - A couple little things like no bathroom vent fans (a big problem with 8 dudes eating BBQ and drinking beer) and the TV not working very well.Overall it was a great place to stay and I would definitely stay there again.",Location
"We were unimpressed with the outside surroundings of the house and cottage. We had to park on the street and then carry your luggage from the street through the gate down the driveway to the back of the house. This wouldn't have been as much of an ordeal had there not been large tree branches limbs and twigs strewn across the driveway. After going to dinner and returning after dark there was no lighting and my husband tripped over this debris trying to navigate back to the cottage. Another issue, although I LOVE dogs, was the large dog that was somewhat intimidating due to barking and jumping onto the window each time we had to walk by the main house. The bed was very comfy too. The only negative inside was the lack of a curtain on a large window that left us having to dress and undress in the bathroom. It was within walking distance to a few wonderful restaurants, which was great. Overall the experience was not great. I do believe just a couple tweaks and it would improve the experience greatly. ",Location
"I'll start with the pros: This space was clean and cute. Plenty of space for a couple (we also had our toddler with us and if you bring a pop-up crib, it should be just fine.) The apartment has it's own entrance and parking space, which was very nice.Now the negatives: The most frustrating part of our experience was the alarm system. We received a very thorough run down of the house via an iphone app provided by the property management company who deals with this listing. But there was no mention of an alarm. When we arrived, we noticed that the alarm would annoyingly beep every time we opened the door. My tech-savvy husband tried to turn that feature off and ended up arming the thing further. When we opened the door again, a crazy loud alarm went off. There was ZERO information with the code to disarm it and when we called the property management, it took them ages to track it down. We ended up getting a visit from the fire department and everything. ",Location

Parking isn't really an issue, either; plenty available nearby.Only negative thing is that it can be a little loud if it's a holiday / busy weekend in one of the bedrooms, due to the fact that it faces the street. Chalk it up to being near everything. ",Noise
"The check in at Jenny's was very easy. The air conditioning worked very well and the bed was super comfy. It was an easy walk to Downtown Austin. The construction was loud, but Jenny had told us about it. It was quiet at night.",Noise
