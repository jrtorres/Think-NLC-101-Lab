"On this visit, I noticed amenities that had been there before, but we just did not see. There were tea and hot cocoa pouches with mints, cups, and even fresh fruit, like a classy hotel. Sadly, somebody else booked additional days I wanted.",Amenities
"Elizabeth was an excellent host! We felt welcomed and comfortable the moment we entered her home. She even left amenities for us, including guides to what was nearby and a map of Austin which was very helpful. The house was in a safe location and it was easy to get to downtown. We would absolutely recommend Elizabeth to anyone who needs a place to stay in Austin.",Amenities
"What a pleasant surprise it was to have such a lovely room to stay in with all of the amenities! It was great visiting with the host family and getting to know them as well. Elizabeth was quick to answer my calls and texts and readily communicated without a problem. Looking forward to the next time I'm in that neck of the woods so I can stay again.",Amenities
"We recently stayed in Sarah's cottage, and while there are some very nice things about it, sadly our experience wasn't as overwhelmingly positive as everyone else's. Positives: the cottage is cute and nicely decorated, with a really nice bathroom (great shower!) and a comfortable bed. It's also quiet, well located and with easy access to the rest of Austin and beyond. Negatives: the WIFI is almost non existent. When we did manage to connect, the signal was so weak it took a long time to load just a single page. As international travellers who can't use data while roaming and rely on free WIFI, this was very frustrating, especially as the property is advertised as having internet. The cottage could also do with some dusting / cleaning. It wasn't too bad (the main things, i.e. bathroom / bed were clean) but things like the fridge, shelves, floor etc. needed some attention. And finally, we also found the host unresponsive and not particularly helpful. ",Amenities
"I never met Sara. The only communication was text messages wanting to know whether we could leave early on thanksgiving so it could be cleaned for next guests. Perhaps she was gone. The house was in a quiet backyard with trees, close to my daughter and the cherrywood coffeehouse where we went everyday. The bed was really really comfortable.The only problems we had were an electric plug near the bed that didn't work and the refrigerator froze all our food even tho it was turned down low. ",Amenities
"A true gem, close to the city centre of Austin. A safe, quiet and beautiful area. The house is clean and has everything you need including dish washer, washing machine and dryer. Comfortable beds. I highly recommend this place. ",Amenities
"Location:Very secluded even though the highway is so close. You pull into a private residential street and then pull into their even more private tree-lined driveway. Very nice peaceful stay. If you need to keep in touch with the hosts, their house is just further down the driveway. On site hiking paths was awesome. Probably would've braved going down the trails more had I had better shoes. The whole property in general looks like an artistic public garden, a hidden jewel. We ended up bringing our car, which makes it easier to travel around and get things that we needed. Amenities:Modern decor, cute breakfast nook, fruits, pastry, snacks, water bottles, coffee/creamer, cups/plates/bowls, extra blankets, books/magazines about Austin, plus all the things you would expect from a hotel except better. They even provided things you didn't expect (like a colander!) but it was a pleasant surprise and we made use of these items.",Amenities
"We planned to stay for four nights and left after one due to feeling unsafe and uncomfortable. The unit is very rundown, and photos and listing description are inaccurate and outdated. Unit does not have a pullout sofa or chairs in dining area that are in the photo. Multiple safety and comfort issues: this is a ground floor unit and the windows were unlocked on arrival and difficult to lock due to broken lock mechanisms, very difficult to find the parking spot, had to unload the dishwasher of previous guest, lack of toilet paper, moderate amount of mold on shower curtain, ceiling lights in bedroom not all functional, multiple table lamps with either missing lightbulbs or burnt out, main bed and pillows not comfortable, shower temperature extremely difficult to control (scalding or too cool), 4-inch cockroach in the bathroom, AC vent above main bedroom door loose and noisy. Plus, the host expects that you load the dishwasher, start laundry, and take out the garbage even though there is an $80 cleaning fee. ",Amenities
"Our view of this accommodation is quite different to others, maybe it's all about expectation. We have been traveling for about a month and this place was the most lacking in modern conveniences. No cable TV (CNN, HBO, Disney JR), no dish washer, no clothes washer/drier, water heater couldn't handle 2 consecutive showers and water pressure is rather low. It's almost 20 km to the Hamilton Pools (pictured with the listing). Interior design was tasteful but rooms are dark. ",Amenities
"My family had to vacate this house after the AC failed in on a 100 degree day in July. I was unimpressed by Top Trip's efforts at fixing the AC, which wasted a whole day of our vacation. My and family and I will not stay at any of Top Trip's properties in the future because of this frustrating experience.The house itself was neither wonderful nor bad, merely meh in a way that would have rendered our stay there an entirely forgettable aspect of our vacation. It is located very close to attractions in South Austin that are enjoyable for adults, children and dogs alike. It has a nice back porch that is a pleasant spot for enjoying an evening breeze. Judging from other property reviews, Top Trip seems capable of addressing minor issues like an empty propane tank in the grill outside.They are not, however, ready to address a real issue like a failed AC unit on a Saturday night. ",Amenities
"Not what I expected. The house is very small. It wasn't a terrible place to stay but here are a couple issues to be aware of. WiFi isn't good in the bedroom, there isn't a tv in the bedroom, the bedroom ISNT private the door opens easily and doesn't lock none of the doors lock, and they kept changing the temperature to a high temperature. Ok good things though include: peaceful place to be, clean, and good accommodations such as towlels, bedding, and blankets.",Amenities
"My stay here was okay. The host responded quickly through Airbnb messaging, but wasn't very helpful in answering my questions. There was no hair dryer and the host did not provide one upon request. Also, there was a french fry on the floor of my room the first day I moved in. No one came to take out the trash for days. There were also a bunch of dirty dishes in the dish washer for days. House keeping came in on one day and only stayed about 30 minutes to clean. I guess you get what you pay for. The amenities are minimal, but overall my stay wasn't bad. ",Amenities
"Librada met us the moment we arrived, helped us settle in, and made sure we had everything we needed -- from the wifi password to fresh towels to coffee and creamer for the next morning. The neighborhood was gorgeous and nicely situated -- near popular spots like South Lamar, South Congress, Barton Springs Pool and Zilker Park -- and the space was perfect for our needs. The cabin is nestled in a little forest of bamboo, making it super dreamy and very serene. ",Amenities
"We came to Austin to attend our daughter's graduation from UT and stayed at Shelley & Carl's bungalow. It was everything we wanted: a bungalow in a quiet shady backyard with a very pleasant garden close to our daughter's apt. in Hyde Park. Perfect for two people. They had the fridge stocked with all kinds of beverages plus fixings for an oatmeal breakfast and several kinds of coffee. The bed was comfortable and there was enough hot water for my wife and I. The bungalow had a sitting area with a tv equipped with Roku and a love seat; the walls are decorated with Swiss skiing posters (from the 50s?). The wifi connection was fast, too. We had a post graduation celebration--including playing bocce--at the bungalow and they were very accommodating to us. They were very friendly and helpful; I hope we have the chance to visit again.",Amenities
"We would not recommend this house for families. The backyard was definitely not kid friendly. There were no stoppers in the tubs in order to bathe children. There was no kitchen disposal, so if one wanted to cook, that would be a consideration.",Amenities
"We had a terrible experience. Initial communication and check in were great. The place was nice at first look. After the first day, the shower broke. I called and reported it and was told it would be fixed that day or the next. 3 days later, it still wasn't fixed and no communication regarding the problem. The dishwasher didn't work. We didn't discover that until the last day. 2 of the 4 nights, was awakened by people outside and barking dog. These noises continued for approximately 30 minutes each night. Quite times were suppose to be from 9:00 PM to 8:00 AM. I reported this too. We will not stay again.",Amenities
"Location and apartment size was ideal for 3 guests, however, we found the listing to be a bit misleading. Air mattress is moldy and barely stays inflated. Bed is a futon. Couch is great, patio is great, cooking utensils in kitchen are very worn and dirty. Towels smelled of mildew. For our purposes, acl was only about 1.5 mi away and therefore ideal. Aside from that aspect and bos great communication I would not stay here again, or would ask that the listing provided be more accurate in amenities and items provided to guests.",Amenities
"Great location and a good size for a quick stay. We had some issues getting into the place and we were not able to store our bags at the hotel that was suggested on the website. The morning we left we had an angry neighbor tell us to basically stop walking so he could sleep from the previous night's shift...not the best way to end our stay! The shower is very tiny and my tall husband felt cramped in the bathroom. We enjoyed the record player and being so close to everything, but we would not stay here again given the cost and inconveniences during our stay.",Amenities
"This was our first Airbnb in Austin, so maybe that is the issue, but I would not stay here again. So far, I have never paid more for less. At around $140 after fees and taxes, I would not expect to be asked to removed linens and start the washing machine. Especially considering that the price includes $30 cleaning fee and linens already in the washer and dryer. Also, we were initially sent the entrance info for the wrong house. Luckily we caught the host before she went into her movie or we would have been stuck. Also, despite cleaning up and seeing no dog mess from our dog on our way out, we paid an additional $25 fee for pet hair. $170 for one night, I would have expected a much better experience.",Amenities
"After one night here, we decided to check out early and unfortunately book a hotel. We had the worst night of sleep because of the poor mattress quality. This Airbnb was advertised as having a __tempur-pedic mattress_ However, this is inaccurate _ in fact, its a complete lie. What was advertised as a tempur-pedic mattress is instead an old, uncomfortable and creaky mattress (which sinks in the middle) masked by an old mattress topper. I even checked the mattress myself to confirm this and have photos for record. Also, the pillows are very uncomfortable - neither of them are standard pillows. My wife and I are doing a cross-country road trip with a long drive ahead of us, and cannot risk being sleepless. The host was kind enough to refund us for the unused duration of our stay, which was much appreciated. We love Airbnb and sometimes its a homerun, and other times its a complete miss. This was definitely the latter and we would not stay here again.",Amenities
"After over two weeks in Airbnbs in Austin we found this one pretty disappointing. We had lots of trouble with the WiFi, the tap water was undrinkable and theres no filter, and the kitchen is lacking a lot of basics. The furniture reminds me of my first apartment, basically whatever I could find on (Hidden by Airbnb) . For the price and compared to all the other great offerings in Austin, this place gets a pass from me. Another made-for-Airbnb apartment that needs much more care to feel like home. Our negative experience aside, Jon and his manager Santi were both great to communicate with and helped us with the WiFi issues we faced as much as they could. Im hopeful that with some more attention this place could be up to par.",Amenities
"We had a great time in Austin staying at Paddy's house. The house is much larger than it looks on the photos, very clean and the moment you step in you feel like home. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again next time I'm back in Austin. ",Cleanliness
"I arrived late in the evening so did not meet Paddy, but her home was lovely and clean and welcoming. She checked in with my friend and I most days to make sure that we had no questions or needed anything. All in all, a very smooth, stress-free experience in Austin!",Cleanliness
"As always, clean, cozy and neat. I love this place. ",Cleanliness
"I enjoyed meeting my hosts when I arrived around dinnertime. They were very gracious in responding to my text message that indicated I was running an hour behind the agreed upon time. I found their home welcoming, and the room provided for me safe, comfortable, and inviting. The instructions were clearly stated. I had a wonderful stay!",Cleanliness
"How do you spell disappointment.I stayed at this location two years ago & thats why I decided to stay again.First of all the minute you walked in there was a stench that I could not figure what it was until the next morning when the cat was at the front door waiting to come in...it was obvious by this cats refusal to go away that he/she was familiar with coming inside.So then it hit me what that smell (Website hidden by Airbnb) great if you are a cat lover and don't mind smelling cat urine.Second, if you leave blankets around, don't leave the ones with blood on them.And how about putting a mattress cover on the mattress. Will never stay here again..and would not recommend anyone to stay there either.",Cleanliness
I would not recommend renting any house from this host because the house he rents out they are unsanitary the bed the couch carpet walls they were all dirty I question the The Host he said we are germophobic if we wanted cleaner house we should pay more. So we left and checked in to local hotel. ,Cleanliness
Very good house with an even better host. Offered us another house when one of our colleagues developed allergies in the house and was very friendly and fast in all answers,Cleanliness
Cozy and well-located. High marks for cleanliness. I have no negative to report. Would certainly reserve this backhouse again- the chickens even grew less wary of this traveler.,Cleanliness
"I don't love leaving negative reviews, but this was disappointing at best. The neighborhood is so Austin kooky, and the studio itself, though pretty rustic, has a cool funky vibe. But the black mold we found under the toilet seat, the grime we wiped out of the shower, the two-inch roach we killed, and the extraordinarily uncomfortable bed made us feel like we'd been swindled. I wouldn't let a friend stay there for free in its present state.",Cleanliness
"The Birdhouse was exactly as described. It was simple and convenient for two of us who mostly just needed and affordable place to sleep and shower as we adventures around the city. We loved the neighborhood and although we only saw Elizabeth once, she was very friendly. ",Cleanliness
"The bedrooms were extremely cluttered with boxes and duffle bags; closets were full of boxes, books, and an extra mattress; other personal items cluttered up the living room and there was leftover food in the fridge. While the apartment appeared to have clean sheets and a plethora of clean towels, the apartment was not nearly as clean as a hotel would be. There was a layer of dust on most of the furniture. The worst offense though was that the showers were not cleaned and he left considerable amounts of bath products in them such as loofahs and a squeegee. All of this could be fixed by a good scrub from professional cleaners. While east Austin was definitely walkable from the apartment, it was farther than we had expected based on the write up (and not something you'd want to do in heels!). The write up of the apartment was misleading in other ways. The write up proclaims that there is a fully stocked beer fridge, but fails to mention it is not for visitor use. ",Cleanliness
"Personally would not stay here again. Host left out important information from her description that ruined the last day/night of our time in Austin. We noticed cat food in the kitchen when we arrived and became fearful that our allergies would flare up, but I was assured we'd be ok when I reviewed the description and saw this home was not suitable for pets. After relaxing on the couch I noticed lots of pet hair on myself and my boyfriend. By the second night we could barely get any sleep because of an allergic reaction. All of that to say, beware if you have pet allergies. Host admitted a dog staying in the home only after I asked about. Also, pull out couch should not be considered a ""bed"".",Cleanliness
"Not as cute as it appears in pictures. Most everything is old and the house has a mildew smell. We had to go get some Fabreeze to use before we could stay in it. No cable tv. Overall just did not feel fresh and clean. The location is great to get to SoCo and downtown. Quiet neighborhood. Old coffee was in the coffee pot, walls could use a cleaning. We would not stay here again.",Cleanliness
"I would NOT stay here again. My friend and I were very disappointed in this AirBNB after staying in others that were far better for the price. It was ran like a grungy motel. The fridge and air were dysfunctional and there were roaches in the house. The floor and bathroom were dirty and there were empty bottles in the shower, like someone lived there. It was also decorated very sparsely and seemed like a makeshift house, rather than an establishment where people are staying. The improvements made on the house were functional ,but looked rushed. Definitely would not pass in a house you want to live in. The owners were never seen, but tried to contact us when we said there were issues. That is not what I want to deal with while on vacation. Worst experience by far on AirBNB.",Cleanliness
"We mostly booked it due to its location and the pool. We stayed here on a really hot week so the pool was a must - that did not disappoint! It was clean + refreshing. Unfortunately, we would not stay here again. The cleanliness is just not up to par. The carpet is really grody and may be due to the fact that there were several dogs in rotation at this apartment. A few of them also barked a good amount. On top of that, the water filter was way past due - and when I went to get ice, the freezer was disgusting. The towels also smell + when you walk into the place there is a definite ""dog"" smell. Finally Gina kept her door unlocked a lot. While this is fine if its just your stuff, our stuff was in the apartment and it made us feel a little unsafe. Fine for one trip - but would not stay here again or recommend. I hardly ever write critical AirBNB reviews + I travel a lot. But I just wish I had dug deeper into these reviews and felt fairly warned before booking.",Cleanliness
"First, Id like to say that the communication about this reservation has been excellent. Instructions were clear and responses were quick. Second, the location is awesome - walking distance to all that downtown has to offer. Third, the price was very competitive for the size and location. Unfortunately, there was also a huge downside: the apartment itself. In a nutshell, this place is NOT FOR FAMILIES. Here is our list of shortcomings: Blinds flimsy. You can see through them even when all the way rotated. At least one was broken. Then we discovered hairy mold-like stuff growing in the top of the window frame. In the pull out sofa, the mattress was very uncomfortable, you can feel every spring. There were unwashed sheets still on the mattress when we opened it up. Drafty windows. Old, stained mattresses on beds. Silverfish in tub. No soap for the bath. Backed up water in the dishwasher. In sum, this is clearly a rental property that no one cares for as a home. I would not stay here again. ",Cleanliness
"I didn't have the opportunity to meet Elizabeth, but the communication was very good and she made us feel so welcome even without her physical presence. The house is beautiful, comfortable, and very clean as well. I was amazed by how much care she took in making the guests feel so welcome and taken care of. The room was filled with so many amenities, including a microwave, coffee, tea, protein bars, lotions, shampoos, all kinds of different things. A very pleasant stay, even though I only spent one night there. I would definitely come back again. ",Communication
Susan is a fantastic host. Great communication. Lovely neighborhood. Short drive away from all the popular tourist sites. Highly recommend!,Communication
"Susan made me feel welcome from the moment that my reservation was accepted, and that continued throughout my stay. Shortly after the reservation was confirmed I received the very comprehensive stay details that I needed to be prepared for my arrival and check-in. As I learned after I arrived, her description of the apartment was just as accurate as the online description and photos that were provided. Arrival and check-in was smooth and effortless, and the apt. had all of the amenities that one might expect and then some. From the Nespresso teas and coffees, flavored waters, microwave and refrigerator to the more than adequate toiletries, Susan seemed to have thought of everything that the traveler might need. The unit was clean, the bed very comfortable, the air conditioning great even with 100-plus degree days. Located in a very pretty, quiet neighborhood, I won't hesitate to book here again. Thanks to Susan and her husband for providing a true ""home away from home"".",Communication
Wonderfully communicative and warm.,Communication
"It sounded like something must have been broken. We sent Brock a courtesy note through the Airbnb app then around 11pm, letting him know he may want to check it out.The response was quite surprising, and felt aggressive. At 3:40am we received a message back asking if we'd ever heard a washing machine before. 10-20 minutes later, another message saying that if it bothered me so much I could use the on site pay machines (even though laundry is listed as an amenity at his location). And even went on to say, «è_«è_«è_Wanna know what my complaint is? Getting woken up at 11:30 on a Monday about a loud washing machine. Poor you.«è_„ùWe were very taken aback by his approach, and tried to de-escalate the situation. To this, he ended up responding again in the morning (in a seemingly more calm manner) that he would have a look after we checked out after our stay. After such an alarming response, we didn't know what to do. So we left it at that, and feel right that futures guests should be aware .",Communication
"Crystal was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. We stayed here for my wedding weekend and it was perfect for our group. We even got ready at the house and had plenty of space. The house is nicely decorated and clean. We really appreciated being able to use the 2 car garage as well. The only con is that there is a bar directly behind the house that plays loud music until about 2 am. Other than that, we loved our stay and would highly recommend it for others!",Communication
"Niki & Veronica's house is one of the best places I've stayed in. The Airbnb photos accurately capture the essence and feel for their house. Niki & Veronica were very communicative and friendly.

Outstanding host! Communicated very clearly on every aspect and her place was sparkling clean,Communication
"Our host did not provide instruction on which room was ours. Upon awkward investigation on our own, we found the previous guest's belongings in our room. Suitcase, items in the closet, items on the nightstand. Our host did not answer our calls or texts in a timely manner to assure us that our accommodations would be made right. A few hours later we heard from Maryam with sincere apologies about the situation. She told us that our bed sheets were being replaced with clean ones. We received a 20% discount for the inconveniences but I think our host is trying to juggle too much. She was going to allow the previous guest to check out late and rely on the guest to change the sheets. It did not work out well. We didn't arrive for check-in until 6pm so it's clear the host was taken advantage of or neither guest nor host can manage their calendars. ",Communication
"BUYER BEWARE this house is listed as an ""entire home"" but there is an older guy that lives upstairs! We were appalled to find someone else walking around in the middle of the night and in the kitchen in the morning considering I was walking around in my sleepwear. Our safety was truly questionable as we had no idea of another guest.Our host was very rude to say the least. She would only communicate with us at 4am and would constantly berate us with convictions and threatened to evict us at 4:30 in the morning because of my service dog. She was very hostile with all her responses and chose to argue with us about the wifi password. It wasn't until the last day of our stay that we received the correct wifi password. We also had trouble with the AC because the man that was staying there turned the air from 69 to 78 every morning around 6AM. ",Communication

I did need to ask some questions/ request something, and the communication was always fast and helpful. My request was accommodated, no problem. I'm not sure a hotel would have done so. Here are some of the things I loved: the Japanese bath (the entire bathroom was sparkly clean), the sheets, the above and beyond comfy mattress, and the supply of ear plugs (I was attending a music fest). The walk around to the apartment reminded me a bit of a spa I've been to in New Mexico, even with the faintest, most relaxing sound of crickets.",Environment
"Susan was an extraordinary host. The house is a beautiful contemporary home in a beautiful, leafy neighborhood filled with gorgeous homes. The unit itself is filled with very nice high-end linens. There are so many lovely touches: decorating, having everything we needed at hand.

If we return to Austin, we will stay with her again!",Environment
"Indeed, the place is a funky, artsy space that was comfortable, clean and safe. The neighborhood is interesting and Sevylla's place is super close to Onnit Academy/Gym so it's a great place to stay if you're taking a certification course there. Easy access to the freeway and a quick jaunt to all the cool places in the downtown area without being in the hustle and bustle of the city. The neighbors have roosters, so it's a good idea to have ear plugs.",Environment
"The studio is funky and hip, a great place to stay only a short drive from downtown. This place is a Super gem. The neighborhood is very family-friendly so don't expect lots of party noises, although the roosters in the neighborhood might wake you up if you're a light sleeper, so bring some earplugs. Personally I really enjoyed the environment and all of the unique birds (greckles, starlings, roosters and chickens). If you want to take the bus, it goes right by the front door. This was my second visit to Sevylla's Studio and I will definitely be coming back for my next trip to Austin",Environment
Absolutely ADORED this camper! Super cozy and stylish! We had everything we needed and more. Loved seeing the neighbor's cats since they were so friendly. One of my favorite things was the outdoor shower... Try to shower at night if you can to catch a glimpse of the stars :) Would definitely recommend and will be staying again next time I'm in Austin!,Environment
"It's a beautiful, spacious and cozy condo. It is well equipped with the basics such as the washer dryer, dish washer, TV, basic bathroom linen/toiletries etc. Very comfortable place. The building is at a great location! Great food and theaters, groceries etc at walkable distance. Gym and pool and coffee in the lobby are great additions! I had a great time. ",Environment
"Overall, a spectacular experience. The only slight downside was that it was a hike to get into downtown Austin, but certainly not insurmountable with a rental car/uber.The pluses way outweighed the location! The big 2 positives were the airstream itself, and the ridiculous hospitality of the Shannons.The airstream itself was super nice - a blend of vintage style and modern amenities. There's a fridge, dish washer, fully stocked kitchen, TV w/ cable, a big nice bed, a porch with great lighting for evening drinks. Everything was nice and worked well.The hospitality was on the next level. The Shannons left us a bottle of tequila and cocktail ingredients, coffee, cereal, local milk in glass bottles, candy.... Most impressively, on morning one we woke up to a tray left on our front porch with delicious breakfast tacos and OJ. Couldn't have nicer things to say about the Shannons, who felt like old friends who were letting my girlfriend and I stay with them on their property. ",Environment

"Comfort: 4/5 This Airbnb was a fairly comfy gem very close to all the action in Austin. The bed was a little hard but absolutely fine for my liking. I had no issue getting sleep, especially with the great temperature and A/C system and the white noise makers. All of the amenities here make you feel right at home at this unique spot in the middle of Austin. Aura: 5/5 If you want a fun, artsy, homish vibe that is symbolic of Austin...look no further. Especially for lone travelers. This place has a great balance of practicality and modern colorful decor. In addition, the inspirational figures and quotes here are pretty awesome too.Other Positives: 5/5 Super unique experience in a great location. Communication was super easy as well as check in. Breakfast bars and a metric ton of Cafe Verona coffee for use. The movie and lounge rooms were sweet and Bill Murray is right there to keep an eye on you. Great airbnb for a great price.",Environment
"While the room was clean... I would not stay here again. I thought I was staying in an Airbnb. I did not realize I was going to be stalked to go through a tour .. which I was not interested in. There is no security features in this building... even less than a hotel. Doors are always open, no security on elevator to get to room and the door to the lounge and pool was always propped open. If you like the hotel atmosphere.. you would probably like this place_not for me.",Environment
"Great great location. But definitely felt a bit unsafe bc we didn't have a locked/secured room, so no security at all of our belongings and renter was a bit sketchy..

She was kind enough to walk me around the neighborhood and make me feel at home.\r\r\r\rAt first I thought the location was a bit far from downtown, but there's a bus route that is a mere 2-blocks from her house and it takes all of 10-minutes to get to The Capital. Biking in the area is great too; it's about a 15-minute bike ride to/from Downtown. Paddy was kind enough to drive me to a bike rental shop.\r\r\r\rThe neighborhood is a bit eclectic with a mixture of Austin locals, artists and activists. I was fortunate to be there the same weekend as East Austin Studio Tours (EAST), which gave me a chance to explore that section of Austin. Paddy & I went to an outdoor performance that was a few blocks from her home, which was fantastic.\r\r\r\rPS: Diego is a cutie.",Hospitality
Paddy couldn't have been a more accommodating host. Her place was comfortable and near the rail line for quick access to downtown. All and all it was a great place to stay.,Hospitality
"I had a very pleasant stay in Austin and Paddy was quite friendly and helpful. She helped me find some places in the neighborhood (which I enjoyed staying in), and her place was like a relaxing oasis. I would definitely stay here again.",Hospitality
"Let me start off by saying that Elizabeth and David are amazing people to get to know, they are very helpful and are great hosts! The area in NW is peaceful, the house is beautiful and cozy and I love the backyard. I will highly recommend my family and friends and anyone to stay with them while visiting Austin. ",Hospitality
I enjoyed my brief stay and hope to visit again-this time longer. They took care of all the little details and I felt very welcomed. ,Hospitality
"Had a great stay. David and Elizabeth are very accommodating and kind. Was not my first stay here, and I would definitely stay again.",Hospitality
"Elizabeth and Dave (and their dog Donny) were AWESOME! They were very friendly and accomodating and they truly made me feel at home. They even invited me to hang out with them and eat dinner with them. (Side note: Elizabeth is an amazing cook!) As for the room, it was very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and it wasn't too far from the downtown area. I would definitely stay here again and I would recommend this place to friends and family traveling to the Austin area. The price is right, the location is ideal, and the hosts are amazing. ",Hospitality
"A+++++. This place is even cuter than pictured. Shelley greeted us, showed us around the bungalow, and even took the time to sit down and write out a list of places we could hike around Austin. There were little custom touches all over the bungalow, it was so clean and well-kept, and the small kitchen off the side was adorable and really nice to have. Also VERY central to everything in the city. Couldn't recommend this place more!!!",Hospitality
Nate's home is perfect for staying close to downtown Austin. His place is very clean and comfortable. The room felt just like staying in a hotel with a little refrigerator and coffee machine. He was more than gracious and easy to communicate with. I would definitely recommend his place as it definitely exceeded my expectations. A++,Hospitality
Scout was super dope and gave us great recommendations,Hospitality
Tremendous hospitality. Would stay again.,Hospitality
"DO NOT STAY WITH THIS HOST! TLDR: When we arrived to the Airbnb we found out Carly, the host, put us in a different apartment than the listing which was a much smaller, dirty apartment and tried to deny the switch. Carly is a dishonest host and does not deserve anyone's business. We booked with Airbnb for 8 people and expected to be staying in the same place that was listed. On our way there Carly sent us a different address claiming that the one on Airbnb was incorrect. When we showed up and looked in the new apartment is was obvious it was not the one pictured in the listing AND there was someone in there still cleaning from the previous guests. The entire place was filthy. ",Hospitality
"Joch was a terrible host & I would never deal with him again. First off I was having trouble finding the unit & he never responded to my texts,Airbnb messages, or phone calls. Once I reached the unit I tried reaching him in regards to the TV not working & their being no toilet paper, he never responded. At about 11pm my boyfriend got fed up with him not responding and called him from his number. A woman answered the phone & said she would look for the Apple TV remote. Joch called back several minutes later & said that the last guest must have taken the remote & he would bring the remote along with toilet paper & that he would be their in less than 5 minutes. He never came, in fact he turned off his phone. Upon further inspection of the unit I noticed that throughout the whole bath tub their were these horrible orange stains. The toilet was filthy & their was no toilet paper! The kitchen was beautiful although cooking utensils were very minimal. ",Hospitality
this place sucked! terrible host!,Hospitality
"I would not stay here. This airbnb was notified of my sister staying with me, and they towed her car! It took 3 hrs and $215 to get it back. Barrett was not remorseful whatsoever and did not offer a reimbursement. I also had to call him more than once to actually get him to give my sister her own parking pass! Ridiculous!",Hospitality
"Pros: The apartment is in an excellent location and close to Rainey Street. There is a great bar scene and food truck area right outside. If you are looking for a fun nightlife experience, this is a perfect spot! Cons: The check-in process was a nightmare and very stressful to get things sorted. This Airbnb is manage by a 3rd party company and the communication experience felt very non personal. You have to use an app for the apartment code and another app for parking - not easy! I felt that I was reading a confusing novel to figure out how to check-in. Even though I registered my rental car with the app, I still got towed and this Airbnb wont pay for my $214 towing fee. They couldn't even verify if my rental car was registered upon check-in to avoid any towing mishaps. Overall: I'm not a fan of this Airbnb experience and would look for another Airbnb in Austin next time. Getting towed and having a poor check-in experience was not fun on vacation. ",Hospitality
"Great place, close enough to everything downtown Austin has, yet just far enough to be relaxing and quiet. An excellent place to regroup and recharge. Paddy respected my privacy and different hours. The place is clean and hip - I would stay with Paddy again. You must be okay with dogs. ",Location
"Our top 5 reasons you'll want to stay here and nowhere else: Location - 15 minutes via rental car to downtown, 1 hr 20 min to San Antonio (must make the side trip!) and less than 3 hours from Dallas for ease of flights. Meticulously cleaned and organized in the flat. Everything you need for cooking (small countertop burner), fridge, dishware and more. Folder and guidebook left in the unit for planning activities, and an additional e-mail from Drew with local favorites. Privacy. We would see Drew and Simone in passing, and it felt like saying hello to neighbors. Very comfortable and private entrance into the flat, noise was never an issue.4. Water pressure in the shower. If you travel often, you know how important a good shower is. While slightly tight for two adults, the shower is well built into the private bath off the flat. ",Location
"Erik and Crystal's place is right in the center of downtown Austin, which makes it perfect walking distance to everything. Erik was a great host who's easily contacted and accommodating to all his guests. Could not recommend this place anymore to someone visiting Austin for the first time like myself.",Location
The condo is in a great location.,Location
"We really enjoyed staying here for our recent bachelor party of 8 guys in Austin. It is in a perfect location that is walkable to all of the happening places downtown. It is a clean, modern condo with very convenient access thanks to the key code doorlock. The only negatives were:- This is an 8 person place, not 10. There are 3 king beds and a pull out. I do not have any idea where you sleep 2 more people. - A couple little things like no bathroom vent fans (a big problem with 8 dudes eating BBQ and drinking beer) and the TV not working very well.Overall it was a great place to stay and I would definitely stay there again.",Location
"We were unimpressed with the outside surroundings of the house and cottage. We had to park on the street and then carry your luggage from the street through the gate down the driveway to the back of the house. This wouldn't have been as much of an ordeal had there not been large tree branches limbs and twigs strewn across the driveway. After going to dinner and returning after dark there was no lighting and my husband tripped over this debris trying to navigate back to the cottage. Another issue, although I LOVE dogs, was the large dog that was somewhat intimidating due to barking and jumping onto the window each time we had to walk by the main house. The bed was very comfy too. The only negative inside was the lack of a curtain on a large window that left us having to dress and undress in the bathroom. It was within walking distance to a few wonderful restaurants, which was great. Overall the experience was not great. I do believe just a couple tweaks and it would improve the experience greatly. ",Location
"I'll start with the pros: This space was clean and cute. Plenty of space for a couple (we also had our toddler with us and if you bring a pop-up crib, it should be just fine.) The apartment has it's own entrance and parking space, which was very nice.Now the negatives: The most frustrating part of our experience was the alarm system. We received a very thorough run down of the house via an iphone app provided by the property management company who deals with this listing. But there was no mention of an alarm. When we arrived, we noticed that the alarm would annoyingly beep every time we opened the door. My tech-savvy husband tried to turn that feature off and ended up arming the thing further. When we opened the door again, a crazy loud alarm went off. There was ZERO information with the code to disarm it and when we called the property management, it took them ages to track it down. We ended up getting a visit from the fire department and everything. ",Location
"The location of the apartment is very convenient and closely located to the 6th st, Rainey and Congress. However, the price during the weekend is way to high in comparison to other properties. ",Location
"Alex's place is adequate, though a bit more run-down than the photos indicate. The location is very convenient.",Location
Perfect location-- close to downtown and located in a safe complex. Would highly recommend to others looking for a place to stay while visiting Austin.,Location
"Easy In, Easy Out. No complaints. Great Location. I'd Book It Again.",Location
Within a few miles of everywhere you want to be.,Location
Great spot,Location
Marjorie has a beautiful home that is perfectly located on the edge of town- just close enough to be walking distance from downtown but far enough away to be peaceful. There are also a lot of cute cafes and restaurants right next door. I wish we could have stayed longer. My family and I had a great time.,Location
"Overall this rental was satisfactory. The pictures are accurate, but to call the unit ""luxurious"" is rather optimistic. Furniture is dated and there are no closets for your clothes. Aside from hand soap and a bottle of body wash there were no extra toiletries (not that we required them). The location is ideal with tons of amenities within walking distance. There is no mention that this unit is on the 3rd floor with no elevator. One of the toilets needed fixing as it ran continuously all night. Wifi was both weak and unreliable, and would drop every few minutes. The unit is described as being in a quiet, residential building. That was not our experience. The majority of people we saw in the other units were in their 20s. I fully recognize Sandeep has no control over the other tenants. I included this because if you are intent on a quiet getaway this may not be the ideal unit for you. Overall, the unit was satisfactory. But I would not stay here again, nor would I recommend this unit to a friend.",Location
"Great location for my conference (just across the road). All amenities promised were provided, communication was great and it was a very practical place. If you seek a functional location to base yourself for the city then this is a great option. The accommodation lacks a homey feeling so I would not stay here for a family trip where I would like to spend a lot of time in this apartment.",Location
Pros: price- good for two people on a budget looking for a weekend to explore. Late checkout- we got a message the night before we needed to the check out that we could take our time and check out with ease which was very nice. Well stocked - had lots of extra towels and paper towels for use. And had free water bottles for us and wifi. Also left instructions to not clean up after ourselves. Cons: location- it's about a 26 minute walk on dark side street's to south congress which is where restaurants and happening places are. Biggest complaint is that the street is not well lit so if you are coming home late it will be dark and a bit creepy. Bathroom- very small. My husband felt tight and he 160 lbs and 5'8. There was also a bad smell and a bug fell out of my towel. Overall I would not stay here again but if you are on a budget it's good for a weekend. ,Location
"Ojas is a wonderful host and he has a beautiful property that has been decorated and stocked very thoughtfully to make a guest's stay comfortable. It is a great place if you want to make meals as the kitchen is fully stocked with everything you could want. The location of the house was not great. It is directly across the street from what appeared to be public housing. We checked in after dark and felt uncomfortable with a man that was hanging out at the corner right across from the house. There was also a car parked out in front of the house with it's lights turned on and engine running. It was a very weird situation. We felt so unsafe that we decided to leave for the airport at 5am, several hours before we need to. there was a problem with people ringing the doorbell at midnight on our second night and his response was immediate and he took care of the situation. I feel very bad giving this kind of review, but I did not feel safe and would not stay here again.",Location
David and Elizabeth are nice friendly people and their house is in a nice quiet neighborhood. I enjoyed my stay there and the room was comfortable and clean. ,Noise
Nice home in a quiet neighborhood. Very hospitable. Extremely comfortable bed. Would stay here again.,Noise
The place is as described. The house is in a quiet and safe location. Elizabeth and David were great hosts. She was also very helpful to me during my search for a place to live as I am new to the area.,Noise
"A very nice, well-kept older QUIET neighborhood close to shopping and a Gold's gym, and probably two minutes from 183 (before it becomes toll). There is offstreet parking, which in an older suburban neighborhood with narrow streets is a *real* score.I was warmly welcomed, the room was large with a desk, and there was a large yard with a deck. The A/C is very good, always important in Texas. The closet is large, and there is a microwave in the bedroom, with tea, etc. The shared bathroom was old, but clean, nicely decorated, and very serviceable. THE MATTRESS IS UNCOMFORTABLE. Be aware.There was a dog, but I only saw it when I arrived. It was very quiet the remainder of the time I was in the house.",Noise
Nice place in a quiet neighborhood. Would highly recommend. Host was very helpful in making sure we were comfortable. ,Noise
Overall we enjoyed our stay. The host did mention in the check-in instruction that voices in the hallway carry easily through the windows so I'd encourage any guest to bring ear plugs and eye mask. (We stayed over the mardi gras weekend.) The unit is on 3rd floor in an apt/condo complex with secured gates. Location is very safe and convenient where there are great restaurants and bars within walking distance. Our self check-in was easy and had enough towels to use. We also enjoyed ESPN channels.,Noise
"description of listing is accurate. RIGHT next to the convention center. Everything was great but I would recommend bringing ear plugs if you like to sleep in ""silence"" because you can hear people walking by on the street or outside of the apt. ",Noise
"Perfect downtown location, place was nice if a little basic and unfortunately surroundings were very loud! ",Noise
"No real issues. Place is clean and nice and well-maintained. Easy to access. Great, super convenient location. Parking isn't really an issue, either; plenty available nearby.Only negative thing is that it can be a little loud if it's a holiday / busy weekend in one of the bedrooms, due to the fact that it faces the street. Chalk it up to being near everything. ",Noise
"The check in at Jenny's was very easy. The air conditioning worked very well and the bed was super comfy. It was an easy walk to Downtown Austin. The construction was loud, but Jenny had told us about it. It was quiet at night.",Noise
"The home accurately depicts the images and is aesthetically well designed in a great location in Travis Heights near South Congress, etc. Some quirks and things to note on value - one of the beds was very squeaky so we changed rooms and the beds felt like doubles. The HVAC unit is dated and super loud, which interrupted our sleep each night from constantly turning on at length... We had to raise our voices during conversation in the living room when A/C kicked on. Subjective complaint(s) - there's post-it notes all over the house that need to be pared down, in my opinion, and picked up in a concise one-pager in the welcome handbook if there's a need to nip the bud from on-going guest complaints and or issues inside the home (modern design = intuitive user experience). We felt like kids staying at a friend's house whose overprotective parents watch over us with all the notes and instructions posted everywhere, along with the lingering ""we may see you during your stay"" noted. 3/5",Noise
"The apt is the lower part of a duplex. I don't know if the upper part of the duplex is also an Airbnb rental but I was disturbed by the noise coming from above and in and out of the front door (some young guys who were very loud and slamming the door at 10pm, 2am). I guess you just need to go out a lot! There also seemed to be a lot of car alarms going off in the neighborhood. It is in a fantastic location to 6th street, a park and several shops/restaurants. There was some coffee, 1 Corona and bottle of wine and some chocolate provided which is thoughtful. Not sure if there was cable? There was a guide in folder but no remote? There is Netflix which is awesome. Keyless entry is good but I could not remember 10 digit code code and had to keep my phone on me at all times. Responsive host when I contacted her regarding a leak. Would stay again. Thank you!",Noise
"The apartment building is pretty old and reminds you of dorm rooms but once inside the unit the place is perfect for yourself and a few guests. It's off 6th street which can be loud, especially on weekends. We did have a few issues with the apartment and the host. The place had a strict no smoking policy but smelt like someone has smoked in the unit that morning. After removing the bug we thought we'd be okay. We left the apartment and went out for some food. After that, we found another two bugs in the middle of the night in one of the beds. We ended up getting relocated to another unit down the hall. Upon moving to the new room, we ended up discovering another 5-8 bugs throughout the apartment. Another thing to note, is due to the location of the apartment building, you get a very rowdy and loud crowd. Overall, I would not stay here again for obvious reasons mentioned above. If your looking for a grimey apartment on dirty 6th, this is your spot.",Noise
