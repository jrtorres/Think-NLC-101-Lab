I was told that if the items were available online that it is and should be delivered within a couple of weeks. I was going to place the order in-store however there was a few people ahead of me there fore I placed the order online instead on XX/XX/XXXX. Today, I still have yet to receive any correspondence from HD however, I have already received a bill due by XX/XX/XXXX for a payment of the purchased I haven't even heard from. Called HD and no time specific on when will the items be available. This totally breaks the special financing offer they claim to have if they are starting financing from the date of purchase and not from the date the item was delivered. What if upon delivery some of the items were damaged? Do I have to wait longer",Store credit card

It is also being stated as a current account.Ive asked for pay to delete but the company says they can not delete it off my credit report",Store credit card
I recently received a letter from Lowe 's stating that my account with them was closed. I would like to report their unfair practices towards XXXX XXXX  card holders. I didn't owe them any money and my card was in good standing. I paid this account off in XXXX or XXXX.The closed my account in XXXX. Damaging my credit score/rating.If you investigate you will find that they have implemented this practice only on their minority card holders.,Store credit card
"Good Evening ; As you can see, I'm very meticulous when it comes to my credit and pay everything on time or even way before it's due. As I was going through my credit report for the last 3-5 years, I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found the late payment on the dates below : XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/2016 - 30 day late payment I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me.",Store credit card
