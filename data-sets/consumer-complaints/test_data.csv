"I pay my monthly balance to Capital One in full each month. Each month they hold my available credit anywhere from   days after receiving my payment. This month, I made the payment, then asked when funds would be released off of their hold. After checking my account today, this is n't the case. Contacted Capital One again, and now in the period of the last 3 days they have changed the date my funds would be available. They flat out lied to me, and then tried to cover it up. They claim that funds are held "" At random '' but this occurs on my account every single month. When you try to get an answer they dodge the question and disconnect the call and/or chat session."

My loan was held by Navient I am a   and have work in the field for 19 years. over this time I have attempted to access federal loan forgiveness and I feel I was miss led and not given the opportunities that i should have. I have made several attempts specifically asking for Loan forgiveness under the   field and time and again i was sent other paperwork or told that what I was asking about did not exist. I was encouraged to put my loans on forbearance and i feel I have paid undue interest due to the Guidance of Navient. I have since moved my loans out of Navient to attempt to save money and get correct repayment structure

"I have called and requested a hardship withdrawal letter from Nationstar mortgage on        . The company told me that the letter would be generated in  2-3 b usiness days and sent to me via postal mail and email. I followed up with phone calls      and     asking if the letter had been generated and made available for me to pass along to m y 401 (  k ) account holder so that my payment can be made, or I would have to ask for another hardship withdrawal letter for a different amount for the month of     or possibly lose my house.

We were attempting to do a short sale. Nationstar mortgage changed the locks on the home and forced the utilities in their name. They supposedly winterized the home but the pipes froze and the home was flooded and had to be completely gutted. They have since been sued by     for their negligence. Theyb forced utitlitiesn in their name but they never put on the required forced insurance. We had received an offer that if not accepted we could have put in the remaining funds to cover it. Nationstar and   kept telling us it was tghen other parties problem. This now reports as a foreclosure. Our ability to sell the home was taken away.

"I have more issues : in order for my lending to process my loan, Carrington Mortgage had to transfer the Appraiser, Carrington Mortgage refused to do this until I paid {$600.00} which according to them was the cost of the appraiser. I mailed in a Cashier check for {$600.00} to Carrington Mortgage. The Appraiser is now transfer to my lender who informs me that they were notified that the appraised has not been paid and payment had to be made before the process could continue. The actual appraiser fee was actually a little over {$400.00} not the {$600.00} I sent to Carrington Mortgage. This is ridicules that a company will falsely charge me money.

I am joint owner on my daughter 's saving and checking account at Navy Federal Credit Union only for the purposes of assisting her when needing to handle transactions as it pertains to her college education. I found out today that this financial institution transferred {$470.00} from my personal account I have with them to my daughters overdrawn account.
