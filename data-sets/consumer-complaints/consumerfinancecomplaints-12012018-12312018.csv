The premium was not automatically removed and, when contacted, the company is now stating that it is a 78 % debt-to-value ratio that must be reached. 

The more concerning problem is that I must submit paperwork to have the premium removed once I hit the debt-to-value ratio. This is not insurance that I purchased on my own ; I was not able to shop around for the best price. Nor am I the benefactor from this insurance policy. 

This extra hurdle to remove the insurance premium from a consumer 's monthly payment is an abuse of power in the customer relationship at best, and fraudulent at worst.

"I applied for, received, and began using a new XXXX 's credit card. One feature of the card that I found attractive was the ability to check the balance and pay the bill online. I was dismayed to find the website will not allow you to use these features if the account is past due ; this policy is not mentioned on the website and a vague error message gives no indication of what has gone wrong. The credit card user is put in the Catch-22 : they can not pay their bill online until the bill is already paid. This policy makes little business sense to me ( why should any company make it harder for them to get paid? ). It leads me to wonder if the policy is a deliberate attempt to make payments difficult so as to increase consumer late fees.",Store credit card
