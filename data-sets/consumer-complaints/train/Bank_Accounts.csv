"I tried closing my checking and savings account with Wells Fargo, but was told to call back. I did, and was told to call back and informed I would n't be charged a fee for having a   balance if I kept the accounts opened. I still want to close the accounts, but now am assessed a fee. I 'd like the fees to be waived and my accounts closed. Thank you",Managing an account
"My wife and I have had a joint account in stock reinvestment dividend plan. This month we were informed by a PG letter dated in 2016 that the Transfer Agent had changed from to Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . effective 2016. We were given an authentication number and a new account number so that we could create a new e-account. However, when I signed into the Wells Fargo website, the legal language specifically wanted us to agree to binding arbitration and other legal wording which essentially would mean that we would have to give up our legal rights to contest any malfeasance by the bank. This is blatantly unfair to us and shareholders of   and other companies. More importantly, it is undemocratic and a clear attempt by this bank to restrict the legal rights of small stockholders like my wife and myself.",Managing an account
"I continue to be charged {$25.00} monthly from citibank. I call every single month and I 'm told the same story about how the charge is being reversed. I have spend over 4 hours on the phone ( not include the times my husband has called ). We want my money back! I did not sign up for an account that would charge me a monthly fee and I am continuously told they have downgraded my account and we will not be charged. When I call or go online I see the charge once again, month after month. This is a deceptive practice and I bet   people are being charged and not realizing it. I do plan on leaving citi, however my mortgage is also with them so it is more difficult to switch banks. Please help!",Managing an account
"I had several checking/saving accounts with citibank, the fees for these accounts were waived since I also had a Citibank mortgage. Citibank changed this policy and started charging fees to my account. I received no notice of this change, there is no mention of this policy change on my recent statements or online in my account.",Managing an account
I signed up for a new checking account with Citibank while they were offering a {$400.00} bonus. I met all the requirements for the promotion and I was told it could take up to 90 days after I met the requirement to receive my bonus. It has been more than 90 days since I met the requirement and I have not received the bonus. Three phone calls and one email chat with Citibank and they tell me I have met the requirements and I should have received the bonus but I will need to wait until the back office is able to review the information.,Managing an account
"I was a customer of a local bank named PNC and I had a personal checking account. When I went to close my personal bank account, the bank issued   cashiers checks. Both checks bounced when deposited into another financial institution. After informing the bank that their cashiers checks bounced, the bank ( PNC ) required me to return the cashiers checks, before re-issuing new valid checks. Because the cashiers checks had been destroyed, the bank has refused to reissue new checks and has not refunded my funds after more than two weeks.",Managing an account
I have submitted several request to Barclays bank as to whether they are FDIC insured or not and up to what amount. They continue to give me the run around and to send me an invalid link to check to see if they are FDIC insured. I do not understand if they are a full regulated bank whey they do not know themselves if they are insured or not?,Managing an account
"My parents bank with a well known bank that I will not name as fear of retribution. My name was on their account. My parents were scammed out of close to {$30000.00} dollars. The bank manager told me she tried to stop my parents and told my father to "" call one of your children '', and yet, never picked the phone up to call me. And yes, they admit to "" some mistakes were made '' but that is not good enough for me. I would like to see that the banking industry do more to protect this vulnerable population. I would like to see that steps be put into place that when a family member calls to alert any bank that they suspect their family members are being scammed, as I did twice and messages were taken and yet no one ever got back to me, that a "" different drop down list comes up '' and they are sent to the banks fraud department, before, not after the fraud has occurred as what happened in my situation.",Managing an account
"I have a bank account with US Bank and created my personal account there. I was told there would be no charges, and there were none for a while. However, recently I have been getting charges on   accounts. I opened   because I was doing the personal banker a favor by opening accounts they called me out of the blue to open. They told me they needed them for the quota for that month. I stated as long as I do not get any fees I will open them I am getting fees on them like monthly maintenance fees and getting coinage fees. I can not afford these fees and I do not apreciate them charging me without my knowledge.",Managing an account
